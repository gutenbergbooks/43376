<h2><a title="Preface" name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The aim of this book is best exhibited by describing its origin.
I am, and have been since early manhood, an editor of newspapers,
magazines and books, and a critic of the last named.
These occupations have forced me into a pretty wide familiarity
with current literature, both periodical and within covers, and
in particular into a familiarity with the current literature of
England and America. It was part of my daily work, for a
good many years, to read the principal English newspapers and
reviews; it has been part of my work, all the time, to read the
more important English novels, essays, poetry and criticism.
An American born and bred, I early noted, as everyone else in
like case must note, certain salient differences between the English
of England and the English of America as practically
spoken and written—differences in vocabulary, in syntax, in the
shades and habits of idiom, and even, coming to the common
speech, in grammar. And I noted too, of course, partly during
visits to England but more largely by a somewhat wide and
intimate intercourse with English people in the United States,
the obvious differences between English and American pronunciation
and intonation.</p>

<p>Greatly interested in these differences—some of them so great
that they led me to seek exchanges of light with Englishmen—I
looked for some work that would describe and account for
them with a show of completeness, and perhaps depict the
process of their origin. I soon found that no such work existed,
either in England or in America—that the whole literature of
the subject was astonishingly meagre and unsatisfactory. There
were several dictionaries of Americanisms, true enough, but
only one of them made any pretension to scientific method, and
even that one was woefully narrow and incomplete. The one
more general treatise, the work of a man foreign to both England
and America in race and education, was more than 40
years old, and full of palpable errors. For the rest, there was
only a fugitive and inconsequential literature—an almost useless
mass of notes and essays, chiefly by the minor sort of pedagogues,
seldom illuminating, save in small details, and often
incredibly ignorant and inaccurate. On the large and important
subject of American pronunciation, for example, I could
find nothing save a few casual essays. On American spelling,
with its wide and constantly visible divergences from English
usages, there was little more. On American grammar there was
nothing whatever. Worse, an important part of the poor literature
that I unearthed was devoted to absurd efforts to prove that
no such thing as an American variety of English existed—that
the differences I constantly encountered in English and that
my English friends encountered in American were chiefly imaginary,
and to be explained away by denying them.</p>

<p>Still intrigued by the subject, and in despair of getting any
illumination from such theoretical masters of it, I began a collection
of materials for my own information, and gradually it
took on a rather formidable bulk. My interest in it being made
known by various articles in the newspapers and magazines, I
began also to receive contributions from other persons of the
same fancy, both English and American, and gradually my collection
fell into a certain order, and I saw the workings of general
laws in what, at first, had appeared to be mere chaos. The
present book then began to take form—its preparation a sort
of recreation from other and far different labor. It is anything
but an exhaustive treatise upon the subject; it is not even an
exhaustive examination of the materials. All it pretends to do
is to articulate some of those materials—to get some approach to
order and coherence into them, and so pave the way for a better
work by some more competent man. That work calls for the
equipment of a first-rate philologist, which I am surely not. All
I have done here is to stake out the field, sometimes borrowing
suggestions from other inquirers and sometimes, as in the case
of American grammar, attempting to run the lines myself.</p>

<p>That it should be regarded as an anti-social act to examine
and exhibit the constantly growing differences between English
and American, as certain American pedants argue sharply—this
doctrine is quite beyond my understanding. All it indicates,
stripped of sophistry, is a somewhat childish effort to gain
the approval of Englishmen—a belated efflorescence of the colonial
spirit, often commingled with fashionable aspiration. The
plain fact is that the English themselves are not deceived, nor
do they grant the approval so ardently sought for. On the contrary,
they are keenly aware of the differences between the two
dialects, and often discuss them, as the following pages show.
Perhaps one dialect, in the long run, will defeat and absorb the
other; if the two nations continue to be partners in great adventures
it may very well happen. But even in that case, something
may be accomplished by examining the differences which
exist today. In some ways, as in intonation, English usage is
plainly better than American. In others, as in spelling, American
usage is as plainly better than English. But in order to
develop usages that the people of both nations will accept it is
obviously necessary to study the differences now visible. This
study thus shows a certain utility. But its chief excuse is its
human interest, for it prods deeply into national idiosyncrasies
and ways of mind, and that sort of prodding is always entertaining.</p>

<p>I am thus neither teacher, nor prophet, nor reformer, but
merely inquirer. The exigencies of my vocation make me almost
completely bilingual; I can write English, as in this clause, quite
as readily as American, as in this here one. Moreover, I have
a hand for a compromise dialect which embodies the common
materials of both, and is thus free from offense on both sides of
the water—as befits the editor of a magazine published in both
countries. But that compromise dialect is the living speech of
neither. What I have tried to do here is to make a first sketch
of the living speech of These States. The work is confessedly
incomplete, and in places very painfully so, but in such enterprises
a man must put an arbitrary term to his labors, lest some
mischance, after years of diligence, take him from them too suddenly
for them to be closed, and his laborious accumulations, as
Ernest Walker says in his book on English surnames, be
"doomed to the waste-basket by harassed executors."</p>

<p>If the opportunity offers in future I shall undoubtedly return
to the subject. For one thing, I am eager to attempt a more
scientific examination of the grammar of the American vulgar
speech, here discussed briefly in Chapter VI. For another thing,
I hope to make further inquiries into the subject of American
surnames of non-English origin. Various other fields invite.
No historical study of American pronunciation exists; the influence
of German, Irish-English, Yiddish and other such immigrant
dialects upon American has never been investigated;
there is no adequate treatise on American geographical names.
Contributions of materials and suggestions for a possible revised
edition of the present book will reach me if addressed to me in
care of the publisher at 220 West Forty-second Street, New York.
I shall also be very grateful for the correction of errors, some
perhaps typographical but others due to faulty information or
mistaken judgment.</p>

<p>In conclusion I borrow a plea in confession and avoidance from
Ben Jonson's pioneer grammar of English, published in incomplete
form after his death. "We have set down," he said, "that
that in our judgment agreeth best with reason and good order.
Which notwithstanding, if it seem to any to be too rough hewed,
let him plane it out more smoothly, and I shall not only not envy
it, but in the behalf of my country most heartily thank him for
so great a benefit; hoping that I shall be thought sufficiently to
have done my part if in tolling this bell I may draw others to
a deeper consideration of the matter; for, touching myself, I
must needs confess that after much painful churning this only
would come which here we have devised."</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Diverging_Streams"></a>
The Diverging Streams</h3>—Thomas Jefferson, with his usual
prevision, saw clearly more than a century ago that the American
people, as they increased in numbers and in the diversity of
their national interests and racial strains, would make changes
in their mother tongue, as they had already made changes in the
political institutions of their inheritance. "The new circumstances
under which we are placed," he wrote to John Waldo
from Monticello on August 16, 1813, "call for new words, new
phrases, and for the transfer of old words to new objects. An
American dialect will therefore be formed."</div>

<p>Nearly a quarter of a century before this, another great American,
and one with an expertness in the matter that the too versatile
Jefferson could not muster, had ventured upon a prophecy
even more bold and specific. He was Noah Webster, then at the
beginning of his stormy career as a lexicographer. In his little
volume of "Dissertations on the English Language," printed in
1789 and dedicated to "His Excellency, Benjamin Franklin,
Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., late President of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania," Webster argued that the time for regarding
English usage and submitting to English authority had already
passed, and that "a future separation of the American tongue
from the English" was "necessary and unavoidable." "Numerous
local causes," he continued, "such as a new country, new
associations of people, new combinations of ideas in arts and
sciences, and some intercourse with tribes wholly unknown in
Europe, will introduce new words into the American tongue.
These causes will produce, in a course of time, a language in
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg002"></a>[Pg002]</span>
North America as different from the future language of England
as the modern Dutch, Danish and Swedish are from the
German, or from one another."<a
name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Neither Jefferson nor Webster put a term upon his prophecy.
They may have been thinking, one or both, of a remote era, not
yet come to dawn, or they may have been thinking, with the
facile imagination of those days, of a period even earlier than
our own. In the latter case, they allowed far too little (and
particularly Webster) for factors that have worked powerfully
against the influences they saw so clearly in operation about
them. One of these factors, obviously, has been the vast improvement
in communications across the ocean, a change scarcely
in vision a century ago. It has brought New York relatively
nearer to London today than it was to Boston, or even to Philadelphia,
during Jefferson's presidency, and that greater proximity
has produced a steady interchange of ideas, opinions, news
and mere gossip. We latter-day Americans know a great deal
more about the everyday affairs of England than the early Americans,
for we read more English books, and have more about the
English in our newspapers, and meet more Englishmen, and go
to England much oftener. The effects of this ceaseless traffic in
ideas and impressions, so plainly visible in politics, in ethics and
aesthetics, and even in the minutae of social intercourse, are also
to be seen in the language. On the one hand there is a swift
exchange of new inventions on both sides, so that much of our
American slang quickly passes to London and the latest English
fashions in pronunciation are almost instantaneously imitated,
at least by a minority, in New York; and on the other hand
the English, by so constantly having the floor, force upon us, out
of their firmer resolution and certitude, a somewhat sneaking
respect for their own greater conservatism of speech, so that our
professors of the language, in the overwhelming main, combat
all signs of differentiation with the utmost diligence, and safeguard
the doctrine that the standards of English are the only
reputable standards of American.</p>

<p>This doctrine, of course, is not supported by the known laws of
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg003"></a>[Pg003]</span>
language, nor has it prevented the large divergences that we
shall presently examine, but all the same it has worked steadily
toward a highly artificial formalism, and as steadily against the
investigation of the actual national speech. Such grammar, so-called,
as is taught in our schools and colleges, is a grammar
standing four-legged upon the theorizings and false inferences
of English Latinists, eager only to break the wild tongue of
Shakespeare to a rule; and its frank aim is to create in us a
high respect for a book language which few of us ever actually
speak and not many of us even learn to write. That language,
heavily artificial though it may be, undoubtedly has notable
merits. It shows a sonority and a stateliness that you must go
to the Latin of the Golden Age to match; its "highly charged
and heavy-shotted" periods, in Matthew Arnold's phrase, serve
admirably the obscurantist purposes of American pedagogy and
of English parliamentary oratory and leader-writing; it is something
for the literary artists of both countries to prove their skill
upon by flouting it. But to the average American, bent upon
expressing his ideas, not stupendously but merely clearly, it
must always remain something vague and remote, like Greek
history or the properties of the parabola, for he never speaks it
or hears it spoken, and seldom encounters it in his everyday
reading. If he learns to write it, which is not often, it is with a
rather depressing sense of its artificiality. He may master it as
a Korean, bred in the colloquial Onmun, may master the literary
Korean-Chinese, but he never thinks in it or quite feels it.</p>

<p>This fact, I daresay, is largely responsible for the notorious
failure of our schools to turn out students who can put their
ideas into words with simplicity and intelligibility. What their
professors try to teach is not their mother-tongue at all, but a dialect
that stands quite outside their common experience, and into
which they have to translate their thoughts, consciously and
painfully. Bad writing consists in making the attempt, and failing
through lack of practise. Good writing consists, as in the
case of Howells, in deliberately throwing overboard the principles
so elaborately inculcated, or, as in the case of Lincoln, in standing
unaware of them. Thus the study of the language he is <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg004"></a>[Pg004]</span>
supposed to use, to the average American, takes on a sort of
bilingual character. On the one hand, he is grounded abominably
in a grammar and syntax that have always been largely artificial,
even in the country where they are supposed to prevail,
and on the other hand he has to pick up the essentials of his actual
speech as best he may. "Literary English," says Van Wyck
Brooks,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "with us is a tradition, just as Anglo-Saxon law with us
is a tradition. They persist, not as the normal expressions of
a race, ... but through prestige and precedent and the will and
habit of a dominating class largely out of touch with a national
fabric unconsciously taking form out of school." What thus
goes on out of school does not interest the guardians of our linguistic
morals. No attempt to deduce the principles of American
grammar, or even of American syntax, from the everyday
speech of decently spoken Americans has ever been made. There
is no scientific study, general and comprehensive in scope, of the
American vocabulary, or of the influences lying at the root of
American word-formation. No American philologist, so far as I
know, has ever deigned to give the same sober attention to the
<i class="abblatin">sermo plebeius</i> of his country that he habitually gives to the
mythical objective case in theoretical English, or to the pronunciation
of Latin, or to the irregular verbs in French.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 2</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Academic_Attitude"></a>The Academic Attitude</h3>—This neglect of the vulgate by those
professionally trained to investigate it, and its disdainful dismissal
when it is considered at all, are among the strangest phenomena
of American scholarship. In all other countries the
everyday speech of the people, and even the speech of the illiterate,
have the constant attention of philologists, and the laws
of their growth and variation are elaborately studied. In
France, to name but one agency, there is the Société des Parlers
de France, with its diligent inquiries into changing forms;
moreover, the Académie itself is endlessly concerned with the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg005"></a>[Pg005]</span>
subject, and is at great pains to observe and note every fluctuation
in usage.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In Germany, amid many other such works, there
are the admirable grammars of the spoken speech by Dr. Otto
Bremer. In Sweden there are several journals devoted to the
study of the vulgate, and the government has recently granted a
subvention of 7500 <i class="abblatin">kronen</i> a year to an organization of scholars
called the Undersökningen av Svenska Folkmaal, formed to investigate
it systematically.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In Norway there is a widespread
movement to overthrow the official Dano-Norwegian, and substitute
a national language based upon the speech of the peasants.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
In Spain the Academia is constantly at work upon its great
Diccionario, Ortografía and Gramática, and revises them at frequent
intervals (the last time in 1914), taking in all new words
as they appear and all new forms of old ones. And in Latin-America,
to come nearer to our own case, the native philologists
have produced a copious literature on the matter closest at hand, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg006"></a>[Pg006]</span>
and one finds in it very excellent works upon the Portuguese
dialect of Brazil, and the variations of Spanish in Mexico, the
Argentine, Chili, Peru, Ecuador, Uraguay and even Honduras
and Costa Rica.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But in the United States the business has attracted
little attention, and less talent. The only existing formal
treatise upon the subject<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was written by a Swede trained in
Germany and is heavy with errors and omissions. And the only
usable dictionary of Americanisms<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was written in England, and
is the work of an expatriated lawyer. Not a single volume by a
native philologist, familiar with the language by daily contact
and professionally equipped for the business, is to be found in
the meagre bibliography.</div>

<p>I am not forgetting, of course, the early explorations of Noah
Webster, of which much more anon, nor the labors of our later
dictionary makers, nor the inquiries of the American Dialect Society,<a
name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
nor even the occasional illuminations of such writers as
Richard Grant White, Thomas S. Lounsbury and Brander Matthews.
But all this preliminary work has left the main field
almost uncharted. Webster, as we shall see, was far more a
reformer of the American dialect than a student of it. He introduced
radical changes into its spelling and pronunciation, but
he showed little understanding of its direction and genius. One
always sees in him, indeed, the teacher rather than the scientific
inquirer; the ardor of his desire to expound and instruct was
only matched by his infinite capacity for observing inaccurately,
and his profound ignorance of elementary philological principles.
In the preface to the first edition of his American Dictionary,
published in 1828—the first in which he added the qualifying
adjective to the title—he argued eloquently for the right
of Americans to shape their own speech without regard to English <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg007"></a>[Pg007]</span>
precedents, but only a year before this he had told Captain
Basil Hall<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that he knew of but fifty genuine Americanisms—a
truly staggering proof of his defective observation. Webster
was the first American professional scholar, and despite his frequent
engrossment in public concerns and his endless public controversies,
there was always something sequestered and almost
medieval about him. The American language that he described
and argued for was seldom the actual tongue of the folks about
him, but often a sort of Volapük made up of one part faulty reporting
and nine parts academic theorizing. In only one department
did he exert any lasting influence, and that was in the
department of orthography. The fact that our spelling is simpler
and usually more logical than the English we chiefly owe to
him. But it is not to be forgotten that the majority of his innovations,
even here, were not adopted, but rejected, nor is it to
be forgotten that spelling is the least of all the factors that shape
and condition a language.</p>

<p>The same caveat lies against the work of the later makers of
dictionaries; they have gone ahead of common usage in the matter
of orthography, but they have hung back in the far more
important matter of vocabulary, and have neglected the most
important matter of idiom altogether. The defect in the work of
the Dialect Society lies in a somewhat similar circumscription
of activity. Its constitution, adopted in 1889, says that "its
object is the investigation of the spoken English of the United
States and Canada," but that investigation, so far, has got little
beyond the accumulation of vocabularies of local dialects, such
as they are. Even in this department its work is very far from
finished, and the Dialect Dictionary announced years ago has not
yet appeared. Until its collections are completed and synchronized,
it will be impossible for its members to make any profitable
inquiry into the general laws underlying the development of
American, or even to attempt a classification of the materials
common to the whole speech. The meagreness of the materials
accumulated in the five slow-moving volumes of <cite>Dialect Notes</cite>
shows clearly, indeed, how little the American philologist is <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg008"></a>[Pg008]</span>
interested in the language that falls upon his ears every hour of
the day. And in <cite>Modern Language Notes</cite> that impression is reinforced,
for its bulky volumes contain exhaustive studies of all
the other living languages and dialects, but only an occasional
essay upon American.</p>

<p>Now add to this general indifference a persistent and often
violent effort to oppose any formal differentiation of English and
American, initiated by English purists but heartily supported by
various Americans, and you come, perhaps, to some understanding
of the unsatisfactory state of the literature of the subject.
The pioneer dictionary of Americanisms, published in 1816 by
John Pickering, a Massachusetts lawyer,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was not only criticized
unkindly; it was roundly denounced as something subtly
impertinent and corrupting, and even Noah Webster took a formidable
fling at it.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Most of the American philologists of the
early days—Witherspoon, Worcester, Fowler, Cobb and their
like—were uncompromising advocates of conformity, and combatted
every indication of a national independence in speech with
the utmost vigilance. One of their company, true enough, stood
out against the rest. He was George Perkins Marsh, and in his
"Lectures on the English Language"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> he argued that "in point
of naked syntactical accuracy, the English of America is not at
all inferior to that of England." But even Marsh expressed the
hope that Americans would not, "with malice prepense, go about
to republicanize our orthography and our syntax, our grammars
and our dictionaries, our nursery hymns (<i class="abblatin">sic</i>) and our Bibles"
to the point of actual separation.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Moreover, he was a philologist
only by courtesy; the regularly ordained school-masters were
all against him. The fear voiced by William C. Fowler, professor
of rhetoric at Amherst, that Americans might "break
loose from the laws of the English language"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> altogether, was <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg009"></a>[Pg009]</span>
echoed by the whole fraternity, and so the corrective bastinado
was laid on.</p>

<p>It remained, however, for two professors of a later day to
launch the doctrine that the independent growth of American
was not only immoral, but a sheer illusion. They were Richard
Grant White, for long the leading American writer upon language
questions, at least in popular esteem, and Thomas S.
Lounsbury, for thirty-five years professor of the English language
and literature in the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, and
an indefatigable controversialist. Both men were of the utmost
industry in research, and both had wide audiences. White's
"Words and Their Uses," published in 1872, was a mine of erudition,
and his "Everyday English," following eight years later,
was another. True enough, Fitzedward Hall, the Anglo-Indian-American
philologist, disposed of many of his etymologies and
otherwise did execution upon him,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but in the main his contentions
held water. Lounsbury was also an adept and favorite
expositor. His attacks upon certain familiar pedantries of the
grammarians were penetrating and effective, and his two books,
"The Standard of Usage in English" and "The Standard of
Pronunciation in English," not to mention his excellent "History
of the English Language" and his numerous magazine articles,
showed a profound knowledge of the early development of
the language, and an admirable spirit of free inquiry. But
both of these laborious scholars, when they turned from English
proper to American English, displayed an unaccountable desire
to deny its existence altogether, and to the support of that denial
they brought a critical method that was anything but unprejudiced.
White devoted not less than eight long articles in the
<cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a
href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to a review of the fourth edition of John <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg010"></a>[Pg010]</span>
Russell Bartlett's American Glossary,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and when he came to the
end he had disposed of nine-tenths of Bartlett's specimens and
called into question the authenticity of at least half of what remained.
And no wonder, for his method was simply that of
erecting tests so difficult and so arbitrary that only the exceptional
word or phrase could pass them, and then only by a sort
of chance. "To stamp a word or a phrase as an Americanism,"
he said, "it is necessary to show that (1) it is of so-called 'American'
origin—that is, that it first came into use in the United
States of North America, or that (2) it has been adopted in those
States from some language other than English, or has been kept
in use there while it has <em>wholly</em> passed out of use in England."
Going further, he argued that unless "the simple words in compound
names" were used in America "in a sense different from
that in which they are used in England" the compound itself
could not be regarded as an Americanism. The absurdity of all
this is apparent when it is remembered that one of his rules
would bar out such obvious Americanisms as the use of <i>sick</i> in
place of <i>ill</i>, of <i>molasses</i> for <i>treacle</i>, and of <i>fall</i> for <i>autumn</i>, for
all of these words, while archaic in England, are by no means
wholly extinct; and that another would dispose of that vast category
of compounds which includes such unmistakably characteristic
Americanisms as <i>joy-ride</i>, <i>rake-off</i>, <i>show-down</i>, <i>up-lift</i>, <i>out-house</i>,
<i>rubber-neck</i>, <i>chair-warmer</i>, <i>fire-eater</i> and <i>back-talk</i>.</p>

<p>Lounsbury went even further. In the course of a series of articles
in <cite>Harper's Magazine</cite>, in 1913,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> he laid down the dogma
that "cultivated speech ... affords the only legitimate basis
of comparison between the language as used in England and in
America," and then went on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>In the only really proper sense of the term, an Americanism is a
word or phrase naturally used by an educated American which under
similar conditions would not be used by an educated Englishman. The
emphasis, it will be seen, lies in the word "educated."</div></div>

<p>This curious criterion, fantastic as it must have seemed to <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg011"></a>[Pg011]</span>
European philologists, was presently reinforced, for in his fourth
article Lounsbury announced that his discussion was "restricted
to the <em>written</em> speech of educated men." The result, of course,
was a wholesale slaughter of Americanisms. If it was not impossible
to reject a word, like White, on the ground that some stray
English poet or other had once used it, it was almost always possible
to reject it on the ground that it was not admitted into the
vocabulary of a college professor when he sat down to compose
formal book-English. What remained was a small company, indeed—and
almost the whole field of American idiom and American
grammar, so full of interest for the less austere explorer,
was closed without even a peek into it.</p>

<p>White and Lounsbury dominated the arena and fixed the
fashion. The later national experts upon the national language,
with a few somewhat timorous exceptions, pass over its peculiarities
without noticing them. So far as I can discover, there is not
a single treatise in type upon one of its most salient characters—the
wide departure of some of its vowel sounds from those of
orthodox English. Marsh, C. H. Grandgent and Robert J. Menner
have printed a number of valuable essays upon the subject,
but there is no work that co-ordinates their inquiries or that attempts
otherwise to cover the field. When, in preparing materials
for the following chapters, I sought to determine the history
of the <i>a</i>-sound in America, I found it necessary to plow
through scores of ancient spelling-books, and to make deductions,
perhaps sometimes rather rash, from the works of Franklin,
Webster and Cobb. Of late the National Council of Teachers of
English has appointed a Committee on American Speech and
sought to let some light into the matter, but as yet its labors are
barely begun and the publications of its members get little beyond
preliminaries. Such an inquiry involves a laboriousness which
should have intrigued Lounsbury: he once counted the number
of times the word <i>female</i> appears in "Vanity Fair." But you
will find only a feeble dealing with the question in his book on
pronunciation. Nor is there any adequate work (for Schele de
Vere's is full of errors and omissions) upon the influences felt
by American through contact with the languages of our millions <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg012"></a>[Pg012]</span>
of immigrants, nor upon our peculiarly rich and characteristic
slang. There are several excellent dictionaries of English slang,
and many more of French slang, but I have been able to find but
one devoted exclusively to American slang, and that one is a
very bad one.</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_View_of_Writing_Men"></a>The View of
Writing Men</h3>—But though the native <i class="abblatin">Gelehrten</i>
thus neglect the vernacular, or even oppose its study, it has been
the object of earnest lay attention since an early day, and that
attention has borne fruit in a considerable accumulation of materials,
if not in any very accurate working out of its origins and
principles. The English, too, have given attention to it—often,
alas, satirically, or even indignantly. For a long while, as we
shall see, they sought to stem its differentiation by heavy denunciations
of its vagaries, and so late as the period of the Civil
War they attached to it that quality of abhorrent barbarism
which they saw as the chief mark of the American people. But
in later years they have viewed it with a greater showing of scientific
calm, and its definite separation from correct English, at
least as a spoken tongue, is now quite frankly admitted. The
Cambridge History of English Literature, for example, says that
English and American are now "notably dissimilar" in vocabulary,
and that the latter is splitting off into a distinct dialect.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The Eleventh Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, going
further, says that the two languages are already so far apart that
"it is not uncommon to meet with [American] newspaper articles
of which an untravelled Englishman would hardly be able to
understand a sentence."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> A great many other academic authorities,
including A. H. Sayce and H. W. and F. G. Fowler,
bear testimony to the same effect.</div>

<p>On turning to the men actually engaged in writing English,
and particularly to those aspiring to an American audience, one
finds nearly all of them adverting, at some time or other, to the
growing difficulties of intercommunication. William Archer, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg013"></a>[Pg013]</span>
Arnold Bennett, H. G. Wells, Sidney Low, the Chestertons and
Kipling are some of those who have dealt with the matter at
length. Low, in an article in the <cite>Westminster Gazette</cite><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a
href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> ironically
headed "Ought American to be Taught in our Schools?"
has described how the latter-day British business man is "puzzled
by his ignorance of colloquial American" and "painfully
hampered" thereby in his handling of American trade. He continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>In the United States of North America the study of the English
tongue forms part of the educational scheme. I gather this because I
find that they have professors of the English language and literature
in the Universities there, and I note that in the schools there are certain
hours alloted for "English" under instructors who specialize in that
subject. This is quite right. English is still far from being a dead
language, and our American kinsfolk are good enough to appreciate
the fact.</div>

<div>But I think we should return the compliment. We ought to learn
the American language in our schools and colleges. At present it is
strangely neglected by the educational authorities. They pay attention
to linguistic attainments of many other kinds, but not to this. How
many thousands of youths are at this moment engaged in puzzling their
brains over Latin and Greek grammar only Whitehall knows. Every
well-conducted seminary has some instructor who is under the delusion
that he is teaching English boys and girls to speak French with a good
Parisian accent. We teach German, Italian, even Spanish, Russian,
modern Greek, Arabic, Hindustani. For a moderate fee you can acquire
a passing acquaintance with any of these tongues at the Berlitz
Institute and the Gouin Schools. But even in these polyglot establishments
there is nobody to teach you American. I have never seen a
grammar of it or a dictionary. I have searched in vain at the book-sellers
for "How to Learn American in Three Weeks" or some similar
compendium. Nothing of the sort exists. The native speech of one
hundred millions of civilized people is as grossly neglected by the publishers
as it is by the schoolmasters. You can find means to learn
Hausa or Swahili or Cape Dutch in London more easily than the expressive,
if difficult, tongue which is spoken in the office, the bar-room,
the tram-car, from the snows of Alaska to the mouths of the Mississippi,
and is enshrined in a literature that is growing in volume and
favor every day.</div></div>

<p>Low then quotes an extract from an American novel appearing <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg014"></a>[Pg014]</span>
serially in an English magazine—an extract including such
Americanisms as <i>side-stepper</i>, <i>saltwater-taffy</i>, <i>Prince-Albert</i>
(coat), <i>boob</i>, <i>bartender</i> and <i>kidding</i>, and many characteristically
American extravagances of metaphor. It might be well argued,
he goes on, that this strange dialect is as near to "the tongue
that Shakespeare spoke" as "the dialect of Bayswater or Brixton,"
but that philological fact does not help to its understanding.
"You might almost as well expect him [the British business
man] to converse freely with a Portuguese railway porter
because he tried to stumble through Caesar when he was in the
Upper Fourth at school."</p>

<p>In the <cite>London Daily Mail</cite>, W. G. Faulkner lately launched this
proposed campaign of education by undertaking to explain various
terms appearing in American moving-pictures to English
spectators. Mr. Faulkner assumed that most of his readers
would understand <i>sombrero</i>, <i>sidewalk</i>, <i>candy-store</i>, <i>freight-car</i>,
<i>boost</i>, <i>elevator</i>, <i>boss</i>, <i>crook</i> and <i>fall</i> (for <i>autumn</i>) without help,
but he found it necessary to define such commonplace Americanisms
as <i>hoodlum</i>, <i>hobo</i>, <i>bunco-steerer</i>, <i>rubber-neck</i>, <i>drummer</i>,
<i>sucker</i>, <i>dive</i> (in the sense of a thieves' resort), <i>clean-up</i>, <i>graft</i>
and <i>to feature</i>. Curiously enough, he proved the reality of the
difficulties he essayed to level by falling into error as to the meanings
of some of the terms he listed, among them <i>dead-beat</i>, <i>flume</i>,
<i>dub</i> and <i>stag</i>. Another English expositor, apparently following
him, thought it necessary to add definitions of <i>hold-up</i>, <i>quitter</i>,
<i>rube</i>, <i>shack</i>, <i>road-agent</i>, <i>cinch</i>, <i>live-wire</i> and <i>scab</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a
href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> but he, too,
mistook the meaning of <i>dead-beat</i>, and in addition he misdefined
<i>band-wagon</i> and substituted <i>get-out</i>, seemingly an invention of
his own, for <i>get-away</i>. Faulkner, somewhat belated in his animosity,
seized the opportunity to read a homily upon the vulgarity
and extravagance of the American language, and argued that
the introduction of its coinages through the moving-picture
theatre (<i>Anglais, cinema</i>) "cannot be regarded without serious <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg015"></a>[Pg015]</span>
misgivings, if only because it generates and encourages mental
indiscipline so far as the choice of expressions is concerned."
In other words, the greater pliability and resourcefulness of
American is a fault to be corrected by the English tendency to
hold to that which is established.</p>

<p>Cecil Chesterton, in the <cite>New Witness</cite>, recently called attention
to the increasing difficulty of intercommunication, not only
verbally, but in writing. The American newspapers, he said,
even the best of them, admit more and more locutions that puzzle
and dismay an English reader. After quoting a characteristic
headline he went on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>I defy any ordinary Englishman to say that that is the English language
or that he can find any intelligible meaning in it. Even a dictionary
will be of no use to him. He must know the language colloquially
or not at all.... No doubt it is easier for an Englishman to
understand American than it would be for a Frenchman to do the same,
just as it is easier for a German to understand Dutch than it would be
for a Spaniard. But it does not make the American language identical
with the English.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></div></div>

<p>Chesterton, however, refrained from denouncing this lack of
identity; on the contrary, he allowed certain merits to American.
"I do not want anybody to suppose," he said, "that the American
language is in any way inferior to ours. In some ways it has
improved upon it in vigor and raciness. In other ways it adheres
more closely to the English of the best period." Testimony
to the same end was furnished before this by William
Archer. "New words," he said, "are begotten by new conditions
of life; and as American life is far more fertile of new conditions
than ours, the tendency toward neologism cannot but
be stronger in America than in England. America has enormously
enriched the language, not only with new words, but
(since the American mind is, on the whole, quicker and wittier
than the English) with apt and luminous colloquial metaphors."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a
href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The list of such quotations might be indefinitely prolonged. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg016"></a>[Pg016]</span>
There is scarcely an English book upon the United States which
does not offer some discussion, more or less profound, of American
peculiarities of speech, both as they are revealed in spoken
discourse (particularly pronunciation and intonation) and as
they show themselves in popular literature and in the newspapers,
and to this discussion protest is often added, as it very
often is by the reviews and newspapers. "The Americans,"
says a typical critic, "have so far progressed with their self-appointed
task of creating an American language that much of
their conversation is now incomprehensible to English people."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a
href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
On our own side there is almost equal evidence of a sense of difference,
despite the fact that the educated American is presumably
trained in orthodox English, and can at least read it without
much feeling of strangeness. "The American," says George
Ade, in his book of travel, "In Pastures New," "must go to
England in order to learn for a dead certainty that he does not
speak the English language.... This pitiful fact comes home
to every American when he arrives in London—that there are
two languages, the English and the American. One is correct;
the other is incorrect. One is a pure and limpid stream; the
other is a stagnant pool, swarming with bacilli."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a
href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This was
written in 1906. Twenty-five years earlier Mark Twain had
made the same observation. "When I speak my native tongue
in its utmost purity in England," he said, "an Englishman
can't understand me at all."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The languages, continued
Mark, "were identical several generations ago, but our changed
conditions and the spread of our people far to the south and far
to the west have made many alterations in our pronunciation,
and have introduced new words among us and changed the
meanings of old ones." Even before this the great humorist
had marked and hailed these differences. Already in "Roughing
It" he was celebrating "the vigorous new vernacular of the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg017"></a>[Pg017]</span>
occidental plains and mountains,"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and in all his writings, even
the most serious, he deliberately engrafted its greater liberty
and more fluent idiom upon the stem of English, and so lent the
dignity of his high achievement to a dialect that was as unmistakably
American as the point of view underlying it.</p>

<p>The same tendency is plainly visible in William Dean Howells.
His novels are mines of American idiom, and his style shows an
undeniable revolt against the trammels of English grammarians.
In 1886 he made a plea in <cite>Harper's</cite> for a concerted effort to put
American on its own legs. "If we bother ourselves," he said,
"to write what the critics imagine to be 'English,' we shall be
priggish and artificial, and still more so if we make our Americans
talk 'English.' ... On our lips our continental English
will differ more and more from the insular English, and we believe
that this is not deplorable but desirable."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a
href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Howells then
proceeded to discuss the nature of the difference, and described
it accurately as determined by the greater rigidity and formality
of the English of modern England. In American, he said, there
was to be seen that easy looseness of phrase and gait which characterized
the English of the Elizabethan era, and particularly
the Elizabethan hospitality to changed meanings and bold metaphors.
American, he argued, made new words much faster than
English, and they were, in the main, words of much greater
daring and savor.</p>

<p>The difference between the two tongues, thus noted by the
writers of both, was made disconcertingly apparent to the American
troops when they first got to France and came into contact
with the English. Fraternizing was made difficult by the wide
divergence in vocabulary and pronunciation—a divergence interpreted
by each side as a sign of uncouthness. The Y. M. C. A.
made a characteristic effort to turn the resultant feeling of
strangeness and homesickness among the Americans to account.
In the <cite>Chicago Tribune's</cite> Paris edition of July 7, 1917, I find a
large advertisement inviting them to make use of the Y. M. C. A. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg018"></a>[Pg018]</span>
clubhouse in the Avenue Montaigue, "where <em>American</em> is
spoken." Earlier in the war the <cite>Illinoiser Staats Zeitung</cite>, no
doubt seeking to keep the sense of difference alive, advertised
that it would "publish articles daily in the <em>American</em> language."</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Foreign_Observers"></a>Foreign Observers</h3>—What English and American laymen have
thus observed has not escaped the notice of continental philologists.
The first edition of Bartlett, published in 1848, brought
forth a long and critical review in the <cite>Archiv für das Studium
der neueren Sprachen und Literaturen</cite> by Prof. Felix Flügel,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a
href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and in the successive volumes of the <cite>Archiv</cite>, down to our own
day, there have been many valuable essays upon Americanisms,
by such men as Herrig, Koehler and Koeppel. Various Dutch
philologists, among them Barentz, Keijzer and Van der Voort,
have also discussed the subject, and a work in French has been
published by G. A. Barringer.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> That, even to the lay Continental,
American and English now differ considerably, is demonstrated
by the fact that many of the popular German <i class="abblatin">Sprachführer</i>
appear in separate editions, <i class="abblatin">Amerikanisch</i> and <i class="abblatin">Englisch</i>.
This is true of the "Metoula Sprachführer" published by Prof.
F. Lanenscheidt<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and of the "Polyglott Kuntz" books.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a
href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
American edition of the latter starts off with the doctrine that
"<i>Jeder, der nach Nord-Amerika oder Australien will, muss Englisch
können</i>," but a great many of the words and phrases that
appear in its examples would be unintelligible to many Englishmen—<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>free-lunch</i>, <i>real-estate agent</i>, <i>buckwheat</i>, <i>corn</i> (for
<i>maize</i>), <i>conductor</i>, <i>pop-corn</i> and <i>drug-store</i>—and a number of
others would suggest false meanings or otherwise puzzle—<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>napkin</i>, <i>saloon</i>, <i>wash-stand</i>, <i>water-pitcher</i> and <i>apple-pie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a
href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> To <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg019"></a>[Pg019]</span>
these pedagogical examples must be added that of Baedeker, of
guide-book celebrity. In his guide-book to the United States,
prepared for Englishmen, he is at pains to explain the meaning
of various American words and phrases.</div>

<p>A philologist of Scandinavian extraction, Elias Molee, has
gone so far as to argue that the acquisition of correct English, to
a people grown so mongrel in blood as the Americans, has become
a useless burden. In place of it he proposes a mixed
tongue, based on English, but admitting various elements from
the other Germanic languages. His grammar, however, is so
much more complex than that of English that most Americans
would probably find his artificial "American" very difficult of
acquirement. At all events it has made no progress.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a
href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 5</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Characters_of_American"></a>The Characters of American</h3>—The characters chiefly noted in
American speech by all who have discussed it are, first, its general
uniformity throughout the country, so that, dialects, properly
speaking, are confined to recent immigrants, to the native
whites of a few isolated areas and to the negroes of the South;
and, secondly, its impatient disdain of rule and precedent, and
hence its large capacity (distinctly greater than that of the English
of England) for taking in new words and phrases and for
manufacturing new locutions out of its own materials. The first
of these characters has struck every observer, native and foreign.
In place of the local dialects of other countries we have a
general <i class="abblatin">Volkssprache</i> for the whole nation, and if it is conditioned <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg020"></a>[Pg020]</span>
at all it is only by minor differences in pronunciation and
by the linguistic struggles of various groups of newcomers.
"The speech of the United States," said Gilbert M. Tucker, "is
quite unlike that of Great Britain in the important particular
that here we have no dialects."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> "We all," said Mr. Taft during
his presidency, "speak the same language and have the same
ideas." "Manners, morals and political views," said the <cite>New
York World</cite>, commenting upon this dictum, "have all undergone
a standardization which is one of the remarkable aspects of
American evolution. Perhaps it is in the uniformity of language
that this development has been most noteworthy. Outside
of the Tennessee mountains and the back country of New England
there is no true dialect."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> "While we have or have had
single counties as large as Great Britain," says another American
observer, "and in some of our states England could be lost,
there is practically no difference between the American spoken
in our 4,039,000 square miles of territory, except as spoken by
foreigners. We, assembled here, would be perfectly understood
by delegates from Texas, Maine, Minnesota, Louisiana, or Alaska,
or from whatever walk of life they might come. We can go to
any of the 75,000 postoffices in this country and be entirely sure
we will be understood, whether we want to buy a stamp or borrow
a match."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "From Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon,"
agrees an English critic, "no trace of a distinct dialect is
to be found. The man from Maine, even though he may be of
inferior education and limited capacity, can completely understand
the man from Oregon."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a
href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></div>

<p>No other country can show such linguistic solidarity, nor any
approach to it—not even Canada, for there a large part of the
population resists learning English altogether. The Little Russian
of the Ukraine is unintelligible to the citizen of Petrograd; <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg021"></a>[Pg021]</span>
the Northern Italian can scarcely follow a conversation in Sicilian;
the Low German from Hamburg is a foreigner in Munich;
the Breton flounders in Gascony. Even in the United Kingdom
there are wide divergences.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a
href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> "When we remember," says the
New International Encyclopaedia<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> "that the dialects of the
countries (<i class="abblatin">sic</i>) in England have marked differences—so marked,
indeed that it may be doubted whether a Lancashire miner and a
Lincolnshire farmer could understand each other—we may well
be proud that our vast country has, strictly speaking, only one
language." This uniformity was noted by the earliest observers;
Pickering called attention to it in the preface to his Vocabulary
and ascribed it, no doubt accurately, to the restlessness of
the Americans, their inheritance of the immigrant spirit, "the
frequent removals of people from one part of our country to
another." It is especially marked in vocabulary and grammatical
forms—the foundation stones of a living speech. There
may be slight differences in pronunciation and intonation—a
Southern softness, a Yankee drawl, a Western burr—but in the
words they use and the way they use them all Americans, even
the least tutored, follow the same line. One observes, of course,
a polite speech and a common speech, but the common speech is
everywhere the same, and its uniform vagaries take the place of
the dialectic variations of other lands. A Boston street-car conductor
could go to work in Chicago, San Francisco or New Orleans
without running the slightest risk of misunderstanding his
new fares. Once he had picked up half a dozen localisms, he
would be, to all linguistic intents and purposes, fully naturalized.</p>

<p>Of the intrinsic differences that separate American from English
the chief have their roots in the obvious disparity between
the environment and traditions of the American people since the
seventeenth century and those of the English. The latter have
lived under a stable social order, and it has impressed upon their
souls their characteristic respect for what is customary and of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg022"></a>[Pg022]</span>
good report. Until the war brought chaos to their institutions,
their whole lives were regulated, perhaps more than those of any
other people save the Spaniards, by a regard for precedent.
The Americans, though largely of the same blood, have felt no
such restraint, and acquired no such habit of conformity. On
the contrary, they have plunged to the other extreme, for the
conditions of life in their new country have put a high value
upon the precisely opposite qualities of curiosity and daring,
and so they have acquired that character of restlessness, that impatience
of forms, that disdain of the dead hand, which now
broadly marks them. From the first, says a recent literary historian,
they have been "less phlegmatic, less conservative than
the English. There were climatic influences, it may be; there
was surely a spirit of intensity everywhere that made for short
effort."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Thus, in the arts, and thus in business, in politics, in
daily intercourse, in habits of mind and speech. The American
is not, in truth, lacking in a capacity for discipline; he has it
highly developed; he submits to leadership readily, and even to
tyranny. But, by a curious twist, it is not the leadership that
is old and decorous that fetches him, but the leadership that is
new and extravagant. He will resist dictation out of the past,
but he will follow a new messiah with almost Russian willingness,
and into the wildest vagaries of economics, religion, morals
and speech. A new fallacy in politics spreads faster in the
United States than anywhere else on earth, and so does a new
fashion in hats, or a new revelation of God, or a new means of
killing time, or a new metaphor or piece of slang.</p>

<p>Thus the American, on his linguistic side, likes to make his
language as he goes along, and not all the hard work of his
grammar teachers can hold the business back. A novelty loses
nothing by the fact that it is a novelty; it rather gains something,
and particularly if it meet the national fancy for the terse,
the vivid, and, above all, the bold and imaginative. The characteristic
American habit of reducing complex concepts to the
starkest abbreviations was already noticeable in colonial times, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg023"></a>[Pg023]</span>
and such highly typical Americanisms as <i>O. K.</i>, <i>N. G.</i>, and <i>P.
D. Q.</i>, have been traced back to the first days of the republic.
Nor are the influences that shaped these early tendencies invisible
today, for the country is still in process of growth, and
no settled social order has yet descended upon it. Institution-making
is still going on, and so is language-making. In so modest
an operation as that which has evolved <i>bunco</i> from <i>buncombe</i>
and <i>bunk</i> from <i>bunco</i> there is evidence of a phenomenon which
the philologist recognizes as belonging to the most primitive and
lusty stages of speech. The American vulgate is not only constantly
making new words, it is also deducing roots from them,
and so giving proof, as Prof. Sayce says, that "the creative powers
of language are even now not extinct."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>But of more importance than its sheer inventions, if only because
much more numerous, are its extensions of the vocabulary,
both absolutely and in ready workableness, by the devices of
rhetoric. The American, from the beginning, has been the most
ardent of recorded rhetoricians. His politics bristles with pungent
epithets; his whole history has been bedizened with tall
talk; his fundamental institutions rest as much upon brilliant
phrases as upon logical ideas. And in small things as in large
he exercises continually an incomparable capacity for projecting
hidden and often fantastic relationships into arresting parts of
speech. Such a term as <i>rubber-neck</i> is almost a complete treatise
on American psychology; it reveals the national habit of
mind more clearly than any labored inquiry could ever reveal it.
It has in it precisely the boldness and disdain of ordered forms
that are so characteristically American, and it has too the grotesque
humor of the country, and the delight in devastating
opprobriums, and the acute feeling for the succinct and savory.
The same qualities are in <i>rough-house</i>, <i>water-wagon</i>,
<i>near-silk</i>, <i>has-been</i>, <i>lame-duck</i> and a thousand other such racy
substantives, and in all the great stock of native verbs and adjectives.
There is, indeed, but a shadowy boundary in these new
coinages between the various parts of speech. <i>Corral</i>, borrowed <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg024"></a>[Pg024]</span>
from the Spanish, immediately becomes a verb and the father of
an adjective. <i>Bust</i>, carved out of <i>burst</i>, erects itself into a noun.
<i>Bum</i>, coming by way of an earlier <i>bummer</i> from the German
<i>bummler</i>, becomes noun, adjective, verb and adverb. Verbs
are fashioned out of substantives by the simple process of prefixing
the preposition: <i>to engineer</i>, <i>to chink</i>, <i>to stump</i>, <i>to hog</i>.
Others grow out of an intermediate adjective, as <i>to boom</i>. Others
are made by torturing nouns with harsh affixes, as <i>to burglarize</i>
and <i>to itemize</i>, or by groping for the root, as <i>to resurrect</i>. Yet
others are changed from intransitive to transitive: a sleeping-car
<i>sleeps</i> thirty passengers. So with the adjectives. They are
made of substantives unchanged: <i>codfish</i>, <i>jitney</i>. Or by bold
combinations: <i>down-and-out</i>, <i>up-state</i>, <i>flat-footed</i>. Or by shading
down suffixes to a barbaric simplicity: <i>scary</i>, <i>classy</i>, <i>tasty</i>.
Or by working over adverbs until they tremble on the brink between
adverb and adjective: <i>right</i> and <i>near</i> are examples.</p>

<p>All of these processes, of course, are also to be observed in the
English of England; in the days of its great Elizabethan growth
they were in the lustiest possible being. They are, indeed,
common to all languages; they keep language alive. But if you
will put the English of today beside the American of today you
will see at once how much more forcibly they are in operation
in the latter than in the former. English has been arrested in
its growth by its purists and grammarians. It shows no living
change in structure and syntax since the days of Anne, and very
little modification in either pronunciation or vocabulary. Its
tendency is to conserve that which is established; to say the new
thing, as nearly as possible, in the old way; to combat all that
expansive gusto which made for its pliancy and resilience in the
days of Shakespeare. In place of the old loose-footedness there
is set up a preciosity which, in one direction, takes the form of
unyielding affectations in the spoken language, and in another
form shows itself in the heavy Johnsonese of current English
writing—the Jargon denounced by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch in
his Cambridge lectures. This "infirmity of speech" Quiller-Couch
finds "in parliamentary debates and in the newspapers"; <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg025"></a>[Pg025]</span>
... "it has become the medium through which Boards of Government,
County Councils, Syndicates, Committees, Commercial
Firms, express the processes as well as the conclusions of their
thought, and so voice the reason of their being." Distinct from
journalese, the two yet overlap, "and have a knack of assimilating
each other's vices."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>American, despite the gallant efforts of the professors, has so
far escaped any such suffocating formalization. We, too, of
course, have our occasional practitioners of the authentic English
Jargon; in the late Grover Cleveland we produced an
acknowledged master of it. But in the main our faults in writing
lie in precisely the opposite direction. That is to say, we
incline toward a directness of statement which, at its greatest,
lacks restraint and urbanity altogether, and toward a hospitality
which often admits novelties for the mere sake of their novelty,
and is quite uncritical of the difference between a genuine improvement
in succinctness and clarity, and mere extravagant raciness.
"The tendency," says one English observer, "is ... to
consider the speech of any man, as any man himself, as good as
any other."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> "All beauty and distinction," says another,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a
href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
"are ruthlessly sacrificed to force." Moreover, this strong revolt
against conventional bonds is by no means confined to the
folk-speech, nor even to the loose conversational English of the
upper classes; it also gets into more studied discourse, both
spoken and written. I glance through the speeches of Dr.
Woodrow Wilson, surely a purist if we have one at all, and find,
in a few moments, half a dozen locutions that an Englishman in
like position would never dream of using, among them <i>we must
get a move on</i>,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a
href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> <i>hog</i> as a verb,<a
name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a
href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> <i>gum-shoe</i> as an adjective with <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg026"></a>[Pg026]</span>
verbal overtones,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> <i>onery</i> in place of <i>ordinary</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a
href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and <i>that is going
some</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> From the earliest days, indeed, English critics have
found this gipsy tendency in our most careful writing. They
denounced it in Marshall, Cooper, Mark Twain, Poe, Lossing,
Lowell and Holmes, and even in Hawthorne and Thoreau; and it
was no less academic a work than W. C. Brownell's "French
Traits" which brought forth, in a London literary journal, the
dictum that "the language most depressing to the cultured Englishman
is the language of the cultured American." Even
"educated American English," agrees the chief of modern English
grammarians, "is now almost entirely independent of British
influence, and differs from it considerably, though as yet not
enough to make the two dialects—American English and British
English—mutually unintelligible."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>American thus shows its character in a constant experimentation,
a wide hospitality to novelty, a steady reaching out for
new and vivid forms. No other tongue of modern times admits
foreign words and phrases more readily; none is more careless
of precedents; none shows a greater fecundity and originality of
fancy. It is producing new words every day, by trope, by agglutination,
by the shedding of inflections, by the merging of
parts of speech, and by sheer brilliance of imagination. It is
full of what Bret Harte called the "sabre-cuts of Saxon"; it
meets Montaigne's ideal of "a succulent and nervous speech,
short and compact, not as much delicated and combed out as
vehement and brusque, rather arbitrary than monotonous, not
pedantic but soldierly, as Suetonius called Caesar's Latin."
One pictures the common materials of English dumped into a
pot, exotic flavorings added, and the bubblings assiduously and
expectantly skimmed. What is old and respected is already in
decay the moment it comes into contact with what is new and
vivid. Let American confront a novel problem alongside <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg027"></a>[Pg027]</span>
English, and immediately its superior imaginativeness and resourcefulness
become obvious. <i>Movie</i> is better than <i>cinema</i>; it is not
only better American, it is better English. <i>Bill-board</i> is better
than <i>hoarding</i>. <i>Office-holder</i> is more honest, more picturesque,
more thoroughly Anglo-Saxon that <i>public-servant</i>. <i>Stem-winder</i>
somehow has more life in it, more fancy and vividness,
than the literal <i>keyless-watch</i>. Turn to the terminology of railroading
(itself, by the way, an Americanism): its creation fell
upon the two peoples equally, but they tackled the job independently.
The English, seeking a figure to denominate the
wedge-shaped fender in front of a locomotive, called it a <i>plough</i>;
the Americans, characteristically, gave it the far more pungent
name of <i>cow-catcher</i>. So with the casting where two rails join.
The English called it a <i>crossing-plate</i>. The Americans, more responsive
to the suggestion in its shape, called it a <i>frog</i>.</p>

<p>This boldness of conceit, of course, makes for vulgarity. Unrestrained
by any critical sense—and the critical sense of the
professors counts for little, for they cry wolf too often—it flowers
in such barbaric inventions as <i>tasty</i>, <i>alright</i>, <i>no-account</i>,
<i>pants</i>, <i>go-aheadativeness</i>, <i>tony</i>, <i>semi-occasional</i>, <i>to fellowship</i>
and <i>to doxologize</i>. Let it be admitted: American is not infrequently
vulgar; the Americans, too, are vulgar (Bayard Taylor
called them "Anglo-Saxons relapsed into semi-barbarism");
America itself is unutterably vulgar. But vulgarity, after all,
means no more than a yielding to natural impulses in the face of
conventional inhibitions, and that yielding to natural impulses
is at the heart of all healthy language-making. The history of
English, like the history of American and every other living
tongue, is a history of vulgarisms that, by their accurate meeting
of real needs, have forced their way into sound usage, and
even into the lifeless catalogues of the grammarians. The colonial
pedants denounced <i>to advocate</i> as bitterly as they ever denounced
<i>to compromit</i> or <i>to happify</i>, and all the English authorities
gave them aid, but it forced itself into the American
language despite them, and today it is even accepted as English
and has got into the Oxford Dictionary. <i>To donate</i>, so late as
1870, was dismissed by Richard Grant White as ignorant and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg028"></a>[Pg028]</span>
abominable and to this day the English will have none of it, but
there is not an American dictionary that doesn't accept it, and
surely no American writer would hesitate to use it.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a
href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> <i>Reliable</i>,
<i>gubernatorial</i>, <i>standpoint</i> and <i>scientist</i> have survived opposition
of equal ferocity. The last-named was coined by William
Whewell, an Englishman, in 1840, but was first adopted in
America. Despite the fact that Fitzedward Hall and other eminent
philologists used it and defended it, it aroused almost incredible
opposition in England. So recently as 1890 it was denounced
by the <cite>London Daily News</cite> as "an ignoble Americanism,"
and according to William Archer it was finally accepted
by the English only "at the point of the bayonet."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a
href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The purist performs a useful office in enforcing a certain
logical regularity upon the process, and in our own case the
omnipresent example of the greater conservatism of the English
corrects our native tendency to go too fast, but the process itself
is as inexorable in its workings as the precession of the
equinoxes, and if we yield to it more eagerly than the English
it is only a proof, perhaps, that the future of what was once the
Anglo-Saxon tongue lies on this side of the water. "The story
of English grammar," says Murison, "is a story of simplification,
of dispensing with grammatical forms."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> And of the
most copious and persistent enlargement of vocabulary and mutation
of idiom ever recorded, perhaps, by descriptive philology.
English now has the brakes on, but American continues to leap
in the dark, and the prodigality of its movement is all the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg029"></a>[Pg029]</span>
indication that is needed of its intrinsic health, its capacity to meet
the ever-changing needs of a restless and iconoclastic people, constantly
fluent in racial composition, and disdainful of hampering
traditions. "Language," says Sayce, "is no artificial product,
contained in books and dictionaries and governed by the
strict rules of impersonal grammarians. It is the living expression
of the mind and spirit of a people, ever changing and shifting,
whose sole standard of correctness is custom and the common
usage of the community.... The first lesson to be learned is
that there is no intrinsic right or wrong in the use of language,
no fixed rules such as are the delight of the teacher of Latin
prose. What is right now will be wrong hereafter, what language
rejected yesterday she accepts today."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Materials_of_American"></a>The Materials of American</h3>—One familiar with the habits of
pedagogues need not be told that, in their grudging discussions
of American, they have spent most of their energies upon vain
attempts to classify its materials. White and Lounsbury, as I
have shown, carried the business to the limits of the preposterous;
when they had finished identifying and cataloguing Americanisms
there were no more Americanisms left to study. The
ladies and gentlemen of the American Dialect Society, though
praiseworthy for their somewhat deliberate industry, fall into a
similar fault, for they are so eager to establish minute dialectic
variations that they forget the general language almost altogether.</div>

<p>Among investigators of less learning there is a more spacious
view of the problem, and the labored categories of White and
Lounsbury are much extended. Pickering, the first to attempt
a list of Americanisms, rehearsed their origin under the following
headings:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<p>1. "We have formed some new words."</p>

<p>2. "To some old ones, that are still in use in England, we have affixed
new significations."
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg030"></a><span
 class="hidden">[Pg030]</span></span></p>

<p>3. "Others, which have long been obsolete in England, are still retained
in common use among us."</p>
</div>

<p>Bartlett, in the second edition of his dictionary, dated 1859,
increased these classes to nine;</p>

<div class="ulist">
<p>1. Archaisms, <i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, old English words, obsolete, or nearly so, in England,
but retained in use in this country.</p>

<p>2. English words used in a different sense from what they are in
England. These include many names of natural objects differently
applied.</p>

<p>3. Words which have retained their original meaning in the United
States, though not in England.</p>

<p>4. English provincialisms adopted into general use in America.</p>

<p>5. Newly coined words, which owe their origin to the productions or
to the circumstances of the country.</p>

<p>6. Words borrowed from European languages, especially the French,
Spanish, Dutch and German.</p>

<p>7. Indian words.</p>

<p>8. Negroisms.</p>

<p>9. Peculiarities of pronunciation.</p>
</div>

<p>Some time before this, but after the publication of Bartlett's
first edition in 1848, William C. Fowler, professor of rhetoric
at Amherst, devoted a brief chapter to "American Dialects" in
his well-known work on English<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a
href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
and in it one finds the following formidable classification of Americanisms:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<p>1. Words borrowed from other languages.</p>

<p class="indent">a. Indian, as <i>Kennebec</i>, <i>Ohio</i>, <i>Tombigbee</i>; <i>sagamore</i>,

<p class="indent">f. Negro, as <i>buckra</i>.</p>


<p>2. Words "introduced from the necessity of our situation, in order to express new ideas."</p>

<p class="indent">a. Words "connected with and flowing from our political institutions,"
as <i>selectman</i>, <i>presidential</i>, <i>congressional</i>, <i>caucus</i>, <i>mass-meeting</i>,

<p>3. Miscellaneous Americanisms.</p>

<p class="indent">a. Words and phrases become obsolete in England, as <i>talented</i>, <i>offset</i> (for <i>set-off</i>), <i>back and forth</i> (for <i>backward and forward</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">b. Old words and phrases "which are now merely provincial in England," as <i>hub</i>, <i>whap</i> (?), <i>to wilt</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">c. Nouns formed from verbs by adding the French suffix <i>-ment</i>, as <i>publishment</i>, <i>releasement</i>, <i>requirement</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">d. Forms of words "which fill the gap or vacancy between two
words which are approved," as <i>obligate</i> (between <i>oblige</i> and <i>obligation</i>)
and <i>variate</i> (between <i>vary</i> and <i>variation</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">e. "Certain compound terms for which the English have different
compounds," as <i>bank-bill</i>, (<i>bank-note</i>), <i>book-store</i> (<i>book-seller's shop</i>),
<i>bottom-land</i> (<i>interval land</i>), <i>clapboard</i> (<i>pale</i>), <i>sea-board</i> (<i>sea-shore</i>),
<i>side-hill</i> (<i>hill-side</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">f. "Certain colloquial phrases, apparently idiomatic, and very expressive,"
as <i>to cave in</i>, <i>to flare up</i>, <i>to flunk out</i>, <i>to fork over</i>, <i>to hold

<p class="indent">g. Intensives, "often a matter of mere temporary fashion," as <i>dreadful</i>, <i>mighty</i>, <i>plaguy</i>, <i>powerful</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">h. "Certain verbs expressing one's state of mind, but partially or
timidly," as <i>to allot upon</i> (for <i>to count upon</i>), <i>to calculate</i>, <i>to expect</i>

<p class="indent">i. "Certain adjectives, expressing not only quality, but one's subjective
feelings in regard to it," as <i>clever</i>, <i>grand</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>likely</i>, <i>smart</i>,

<p class="indent">l. "Low expressions, mostly political," as <i>slangwhanger</i>, <i>loco foco</i>,

</div>

<p>Elwyn, in 1859, attempted no classification.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a
href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> He confined his
glossary to archaic English words surviving in America, and
sought only to prove that they had come down "from our remotest
ancestry" and were thus undeserving of the reviling <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg032"></a>[Pg032]</span>
lavished upon them by English critics. Schele de Vere, in 1872,
followed Bartlett, and devoted himself largely to words borrowed
from the Indian dialects, and from the French, Spanish
and Dutch. But Farmer, in 1889,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> ventured upon a new classification,
prefacing it with the following definition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>An Americanism may be defined as a word or phrase, old or new,
employed by general or respectable usage in America in a way not
sanctioned by the best standards of the English language. As a matter
of fact, however, the term has come to possess a wider meaning,
and it is now applied not only to words and phrases which can be so
described, but also to the new and legitimately born words adapted to
the general needs and usages, to the survivals of an older form of English
than that now current in the mother country, and to the racy,
pungent vernacular of Western life.</div></div>

<p>He then proceeded to classify his materials thus:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<p>1. Words and phrases of purely American derivation, embracing
words originating in:</p>

<p class="indent">a. Indian and aboriginal life.</p>

<p class="indent">b. Pioneer and frontier life.</p>

<p class="indent">c. The church.</p>

<p class="indent">d. Politics.</p>

<p class="indent">e. Trades of all kinds.</p>

<p class="indent">f. Travel, afloat and ashore.</p>

<p>2. Words brought by colonists, including:</p>

<p class="indent">a. The German element.</p>

<p class="indent">b. The French.</p>

<p class="indent">c. The Spanish.</p>

<p class="indent">d. The Dutch.</p>

<p class="indent">e. The negro.</p>

<p class="indent">f. The Chinese.</p>

<p>3. Names of American things, embracing:</p>

<p class="indent">a. Natural products.</p>

<p class="indent">b. Manufactured articles.</p>

<p>4. Perverted English words.</p>

<p>5. Obsolete English words still in good use in America.</p>

<p>6. English words, American by inflection and modification.</p>

<p>7. Odd and ignorant popular phrases, proverbs, vulgarisms, and colloquialisms, cant and slang.</p>

<p>8. Individualisms.</p>

<p>9. Doubtful and miscellaneous.</p>
</div>

<div class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg033"></a><span class="hidden">[Pg033]</span>
<!--There are links to this anchor; don't delete it.--></div>

<p>Clapin, in 1902,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a
href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> reduced these
categories to four:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<p>1. Genuine English words, obsolete or provincial in England, and universally
used in the United States.</p>

<p>2. English words conveying, in the United States, a different meaning
from that attached to them in England.</p>

<p>3. Words introduced from other languages than the English:—French,
Dutch, Spanish, German, Indian, etc.</p>

<p>4. Americanisms proper, <i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, words coined in the country, either
representing some new idea or peculiar product.
</p>
</div>

<p>Thornton, in 1912, substituted the following:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<p>1. Forms of speech now obsolete or provincial in England, which survive
in the United States, such as <i>allow</i>, <i>bureau</i>, <i>fall</i>, <i>gotten</i>, <i>guess</i>,
<i>likely</i>, <i>professor</i>, <i>shoat</i>.</p>

<p>2. Words and phrases of distinctly American origin, such as <i>belittle</i>,
<i>lengthy</i>, <i>lightning-rod</i>, <i>to darken one's doors</i>, <i>to bark up the wrong tree</i>,
<i>to come out at the little end of the horn</i>, <i>blind tiger</i>, <i>cold snap</i>, <i>gay
Quaker</i>, <i>gone coon</i>, <i>long sauce</i>, <i>pay dirt</i>, <i>small potatoes</i>, <i>some pumpkins</i>.</p>

<p>3. Nouns which indicate quadrupeds, birds, trees, articles of food, etc.,
that are distinctively American, such as <i>ground-hog</i>, <i>hang-bird</i>, <i>hominy</i>,
<i>live-oak</i>, <i>locust</i>, <i>opossum</i>, <i>persimmon</i>, <i>pone</i>, <i>succotash</i>, <i>wampum</i>, <i>wigwam</i>.</p>

<p>4. Names of persons and classes of persons, and of places, such as
<i>Buckeye</i>, <i>Cracker</i>, <i>Greaser</i>, <i>Hoosier</i>, <i>Old Bullion</i>, <i>Old Hickory</i>, the
<i>Little Giant</i>, <i>Dixie</i>, <i>Gotham</i>, the <i>Bay State</i>, the <i>Monumental City</i>.</p>

<p>5. Words which have assumed a new meaning, such as <i>card</i>, <i>clever</i>,
<i>fork</i>, <i>help</i>, <i>penny</i>, <i>plunder</i>, <i>raise</i>,
<i>rock</i>, <i>sack</i>, <i>ticket</i>, <i>windfall</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition, Thornton added a provisional class of "words and
phrases of which I have found earlier examples in American
than in English writers; ... with the <i>caveat</i> that further research
may reverse the claim"—a class offering specimens in
<i>alarmist</i>, <i>capitalize</i>, <i>eruptiveness</i>, <i>horse of another colour</i> (<i class="abblatin">sic!</i>),
<i>the jig's up</i>, <i>nameable</i>, <i>omnibus bill</i>, <i>propaganda</i> and <i>whitewash</i>.</p>

<p>No more than a brief glance at these classifications is needed to
show that they hamper the inquiry by limiting its scope—not so
much, to be sure, as the ridiculous limitations of White and
Lounsbury, but still very seriously. They meet the ends of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg034"></a>[Pg034]</span>
purely descriptive lexicography, but largely leave out of account
some of the most salient characters of a living language, for
example, pronunciation and idiom. Only Bartlett and Farmer
establish a separate category of Americanisms produced by
changes in pronunciation, though even Thornton, of course, is
obliged to take notice of such forms as <i>bust</i> and <i>bile</i>. None of
them, however, goes into the matter at any length, nor even into
the matter of etymology. Bartlett's etymologies are scanty and
often inaccurate; Schele de Vere's are sometimes quite fanciful;
Thornton offers scarcely any at all. The best of these collections
of Americanisms, and by long odds, is Thornton's. It
presents an enormous mass of quotations, and they are all very
carefully dated, and it corrects most of the more obvious errors
in the work of earlier inquirers. But its very dependence upon
quotations limits it chiefly to the written language, and so the
enormously richer materials of the spoken language are passed
over, and particularly the materials evolved during the past
twenty years. One searches the two fat volumes in vain for
such highly characteristic forms as <i>would of</i>, <i>near-accident</i>, and
<i>buttinski</i>, the use of <i>sure</i> as an adverb, and the employment of
<i>well</i> as a sort of general equivalent of the German <i>also</i>.</p>

<p>These grammatical and syntactical tendencies are beyond the
scope of Thornton's investigation, but it is plain that they must
be prime concerns of any future student who essays to get at the
inner spirit of the language. Its difference from standard English
is not merely a difference in vocabulary, to be disposed of
in an alphabetical list; it is, above all, a difference in pronunciation,
in intonation, in conjugation and declension, in metaphor
and idiom, in the whole fashion of using words. A page from
one of Ring W. Lardner's baseball stories contains few words
that are not in the English vocabulary, and yet the thoroughly
American color of it cannot fail to escape anyone who actually
listens to the tongue spoken around him. Some of the elements
which enter into that color will be considered in the following
pages. The American vocabulary, of course, must be given
first attention, for in it the earliest American divergences are
embalmed and it tends to grow richer and freer year after year, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg035"></a>[Pg035]</span>
but attention will also be paid to materials and ways of speech
that are less obvious, and in particular to certain definite tendencies
of the grammar of spoken American, hitherto wholly
neglected.</p>

In the preface to the first edition of its dictionary (1694) it disclaimed
any purpose "to make new words and to reject others at its pleasure."
In the preface to the second edition (1718) it confessed that "ignorance
and corruption often introduce manners of writing" and that "convenience
establishes them." In the preface to the third edition (1740)
it admitted that it was "forced to admit changes which the public has
made." And so on. Says D. M. Robertson, in A History of the French
Academy (London, 1910): "The Academy repudiates any assumption of
authority over the language with which the public in its own practise has
not first clothed it. So much, indeed, does it confine itself to an interpretation
merely of the laws of language that its decisions are sometimes contrary
to its own judgment of what is either desirable or expedient."</p></div>

Storting passed the first of a series of acts designed to put the two languages
on equal footing. Four years later, after a campaign going back to
1874, provision was made for teaching the <i>landsmaal</i> in the schools for the
training of primary teachers. In 1899 a professorship of the <i>landsmaal</i> was
established in the University of Christiania. The school boards in the case
of primary schools, and the pupils in the case of middle and high schools
are now permitted to choose between the two languages, and the <i>landsmaal</i>
has been given official status by the State Church. The chief impediment
to its wider acceptance lies in the fact that it is not, as it stands, a natural
language, but an artificial amalgamation of peasant dialects. It was devised
in 1848-50 by Ivar Aasen. <i class="abblatin">Vide</i> The Language Question, <cite>London

The Beginnings of American</h2>

<p class="ph3number">§ 1</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="In_Colonial_Days"></a>
In Colonial Days</h3>—William Gifford, the first editor of the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, is authority for the tale that some of the Puritan
clergy of New England, during the Revolution, proposed
that English be formally abandoned as the national language of
America, and Hebrew adopted in its place. An American
chronicler, Charles Astor Bristed, makes the proposed tongue
Greek, and reports that the change was rejected on the ground
that "it would be more convenient for us to keep the language
as it is, and make the English speak Greek."<a name="FNanchor_1_62" id="FNanchor_1_62"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_62" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The story,
though it has the support of the editors of the Cambridge History
of American Literature,<a name="FNanchor_2_63" id="FNanchor_2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_63" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has an apocryphal smack; one suspects
that the savagely anti-American Gifford invented it. But,
true or false, it well indicates the temper of those times. The
passion for complete political independence of England bred a
general hostility to all English authority, whatever its character,
and that hostility, in the direction of present concern to us,
culminated in the revolutionary attitude of Noah Webster's
"Dissertations on the English Language," printed in 1789.
Webster harbored no fantastic notion of abandoning English
altogether, but he was eager to set up American as a distinct
and independent dialect. "Let us," he said, "seize the present
moment, and establish a national language as well as a national
government.... As an independent nation our honor requires <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg037"></a>[Pg037]</span>
us to have a system of our own, in language as well as government."</div>

<p>Long before this the challenge had been flung. Scarcely two
years after the Declaration of Independence Franklin was instructed
by Congress, on his appointment as minister to France,
to employ "the language of the United States," not simply English,
in all his "replies or answers" to the communications of the
ministry of Louis XVI. And eight years before the Declaration
Franklin himself had drawn up a characteristically American
scheme of spelling reform, and had offered plenty of proof
in it, perhaps unconsciously, that the standards of spelling and
pronunciation in the New World had already diverged noticeably
from those accepted on the other side of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_3_64" id="FNanchor_3_64"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_64" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In
acknowledging the dedication of Webster's "Dissertations"
Franklin endorsed both his revolt against English domination
and his forecast of widening differences in future, though protesting
at the same time against certain Americanisms that have
since come into good usage, and even migrated to England.<a name="FNanchor_4_65" id="FNanchor_4_65"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_65" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>This protest was marked by Franklin's habitual mildness, but
in other quarters dissent was voiced with far less urbanity. The
growing independence of the colonial dialect, not only in its
spoken form, but also in its most dignified written form, had
begun, indeed, to attract the attention of purists in both England
and America, and they sought to dispose of it in its infancy
by <i class="abblatin">force majeure</i>. One of the first and most vigorous of the
attacks upon it was delivered by John Witherspoon, a Scotch
clergyman who came out in 1769 to be president of Princeton
<i class="abblatin">in partibus infidelium</i>. This Witherspoon brought a Scotch
hatred of the English with him, and at once became a leader of
the party of independence; he signed the Declaration to the
tune of much rhetoric, and was the only clergyman to sit in the
Continental Congress. But in matters of learning he was orthodox
to the point of hunkerousness, and the strange locutions that <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg038"></a>[Pg038]</span>
he encountered on all sides aroused his pedagogic ire. "I have
heard in this country," he wrote in 1781, "in the senate, at the
bar, and from the pulpit, and see daily in dissertations from
the press, errors in grammar, improprieties and vulgarisms which
hardly any person of the same class in point of rank and literature
would have fallen into in Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_5_66" id="FNanchor_5_66"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5_66" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It was Witherspoon
who coined the word <i>Americanism</i>—and at once the English
guardians of the sacred vessels began employing it as a
general synonym for vulgarism and barbarism. Another learned
immigrant, the Rev. Jonathan Boucher, soon joined him. This
Boucher was a friend of Washington, but was driven back to
England by his Loyalist sentiments. He took revenge by printing
various charges against the Americans, among them that of
"making all the haste they can to rid themselves of the [English]
language."</p>

<p>After the opening of the new century all the British reviews
maintained an eager watchfulness for these abhorrent inventions,
and denounced them, when found, with the utmost vehemence.
The <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, which led the charge, opened its
attack in October, 1804, and the appearance of the five volumes
of Chief Justice Marshall's "Life of George Washington," during
the three years following, gave the signal for corrective
articles in the <cite>British Critic</cite>, the <cite>Critical Review</cite>, the <cite>Annual</cite>,
the <cite>Monthly</cite> and the <cite>Eclectic</cite>. The <cite>British Critic</cite>, in April,
1808, admitted somewhat despairingly that the damage was
already done—that "the common speech of the United States
has departed very considerably from the standard adopted in
England." The others, however, sought to stay the flood by
invective against Marshall and, later, against his rival biographer,
the Rev. Aaron Bancroft. The <cite>Annual</cite>, in 1808, pronounced
its high curse and anathema upon "that torrent of barbarous
phraseology" which was pouring across the Atlantic,
and which threatened "to destroy the purity of the English
language."<a name="FNanchor_6_67" id="FNanchor_6_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_67" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In Bancroft's "Life of George Washington" <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg039"></a>[Pg039]</span>
(1808), according to the <cite>British Critic</cite>, there were gross Americanisms,
inordinately offensive to Englishmen, "at almost every
page."</p>

<p>The Rev. Jeremy Belknap, long anticipating Elwyn, White
and Lounsbury, tried to obtain a respite from this abuse by
pointing out the obvious fact that many of the Americanisms
under fire were merely survivors of an English that had become
archaic in England, but this effort counted for little, for on the
one hand the British purists enjoyed the chase too much to give
it up, and on the other hand there began to dawn in America
a new spirit of nationality, at first very faint, which viewed the
differences objected to, not with shame, but with a fierce sort of
pride. In the first volume of the <cite>North American Review</cite> William
Ellery Channing spoke out boldly for "the American language
and literature,"<a name="FNanchor_7_68" id="FNanchor_7_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_68" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and a year later Pickering published
his defiant dictionary of "words and phrases which have been
supposed to be peculiar to the United States." This thin collection
of 500 specimens set off a dispute which yet rages on
both sides of the Atlantic. Pickering, however, was undismayed.
He had begun to notice the growing difference between the English
and American vocabulary and pronunciation, he said, while
living in London from 1799 to 1801, and he had made his collections
with the utmost care, and after taking counsel with
various prudent authorities, both English and American. Already
in the first year of the century, he continued, the English
had accused the people of the new republic of a deliberate "design
to effect an entire change in the language" and while no
such design was actually harbored, the facts were the facts, and
he cited the current newspapers, the speeches from pulpit and
rostrum, and Webster himself in support of them. This debate
over Pickering's list, as I say, still continues. Lounsbury, entrenched
behind his grotesque categories, once charged that
four-fifths of the words in it had "no business to be there," and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg040"></a>[Pg040]</span>
Gilbert M. Tucker<a name="FNanchor_8_69" id="FNanchor_8_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_69" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has argued that only 70 of them were genuine
Americanisms. But a careful study of the list, in comparison
with the early quotations recently collected by Thornton, seems
to indicate that both of these judgments, and many others no
less, have done injustice to Pickering. He made the usual errors
of the pioneer, but his sound contributions to the subject
were anything but inconsiderable, and it is impossible to forget
his diligence and his constant shrewdness. He established firmly
the native origin of a number of words now in universal use in
America—<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>backwoodsman</i>, <i>breadstuffs</i>, <i>caucus</i>, <i>clapboard</i>,
<i>sleigh</i> and <i>squatter</i>—and of such familiar derivatives as <i>gubernatorial</i>
and <i>dutiable</i>, and he worked out the genesis of not a few
loan-words, including <i>prairie</i>, <i>scow</i>, <i>rapids</i>, <i>hominy</i> and <i>barbecue</i>.
It was not until 1848, when the first edition of Bartlett appeared,
that his work was supplanted.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 2</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Sources_of_Early_Americanisms"></a>Sources of Early Americanisms</h3>—The first genuine Americanisms
were undoubtedly words borrowed bodily from the Indian
dialects—words, in the main, indicating natural objects that had
no counterparts in England. We find <i>opossum</i>, for example,
in the form of <i>opasum</i>, in Captain John Smith's "Map of Virginia"
(1612), and, in the form of <i>apossoun</i>, in a Virginia document
two years older. <i>Moose</i> is almost as old. The word is
borrowed from the Algonquin <i>musa</i>, and must have become familiar
to the Pilgrim Fathers soon after their landing in 1620,
for the woods of Massachusetts then swarmed with the huge
quadrupeds and there was no English name to designate them.
Again, there are <i>skunk</i> (from the Abenaki Indian <i>seganku</i>),
<i>hickory</i>, <i>squash</i>, <i>paw-paw</i>, <i>raccoon</i>, <i>chinkapin</i>, <i>porgy</i>, <i>chipmunk</i>,
<i>pemmican</i>, <i>terrapin</i>, <i>menhaden</i>, <i>catalpa</i>, <i>persimmon</i> and
<i>cougar</i>. Of these, <i>hickory</i> and <i>terrapin</i> are to be found in Robert
Beverley's "History and Present State of Virginia" (1705),
and <i>squash</i>, <i>chinkapin</i> and <i>persimmon</i> are in documents of the
preceding century. Many of these words, of course, were shortened <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg041"></a>[Pg041]</span>
or otherwise modified on being taken into colonial English.
Thus <i>chinkapin</i> was originally <i>checkinqumin</i>, and <i>squash</i> appears
in early documents as <i>isquontersquash</i>, <i>askutasquash</i>, <i>isquonkersquash</i>
and <i>squantersquash</i>. But William Penn, in a letter
dated August 16, 1683, used the latter in its present form. Its
variations show a familiar effort to bring a new and strange
word into harmony with the language—an effort arising from
what philologists call the law of Hobson-Jobson. This name
was given to it by Col. Henry Yule and A. C. Burnell, compilers
of a standard dictionary of Anglo-Indian terms. They found
that the British soldiers in India, hearing strange words from
the lips of the natives, often converted them into English words
of similar sound, though of widely different meaning. Thus
the words <i>Hassan</i> and <i>Hosein</i>, frequently used by the Mohammedans
of the country in their devotions, were turned into
<i>Hobson-Jobson</i>. The same process is constantly in operation
elsewhere. By it the French <i>route de roi</i> has become <i>Rotten
Row</i> in English, <i>écrevisse</i> has become <i>crayfish</i>, and the English
<i>bowsprit</i> has become <i>beau pré</i> (=<i>beautiful meadow</i>) in French.
The word <i>pigeon</i>, in <i>Pigeon English</i>, offers another example; it
has no connection with the bird, but merely represents a Chinaman's
attempt to pronounce the word <i>business</i>. No doubt <i>squash</i>
originated in the same way. That <i>woodchuck</i> did so is practically
certain. Its origin is to be sought, not in <i>wood</i> and
<i>chuck</i>, but in the Cree word <i>otchock</i>, used by the Indians to
designate the animal.</div>

<p>In addition to the names of natural objects, the early colonists,
of course, took over a great many Indian place-names, and a
number of words to designate Indian relations and artificial objects
in Indian use. To the last division belong <i>hominy</i>, <i>pone</i>,
<i>toboggan</i>, <i>canoe</i>, <i>tapioca</i>, <i>moccasin</i>, <i>pow-wow</i>, <i>papoose</i>, <i>tomahawk</i>,
<i>wigwam</i>, <i>succotash</i> and <i>squaw</i>, all of which were in common
circulation by the beginning of the eighteenth century.
Finally, new words were made during the period by translating
Indian terms, for example, <i>war-path</i>, <i>war-paint</i>, <i>pale-face</i>, <i>medicine-man</i>,
<i>pipe-of-peace</i> and <i>fire-water</i>. The total number of
such borrowings, direct and indirect, was a good deal larger <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg042"></a>[Pg042]</span>
than now appears, for with the disappearance of the red man
the use of loan-words from his dialects has decreased. In our
own time such words as <i>papoose</i>, <i>sachem</i>, <i>tepee</i>, <i>wigwam</i> and
<i>wampum</i> have begun to drop out of everyday use;<a name="FNanchor_9_70" id="FNanchor_9_70"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9_70" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> at an earlier
period the language sloughed off <i>ocelot</i>, <i>manitee</i>, <i>calumet</i>, <i>supawn</i>,
<i>samp</i> and <i>quahaug</i>, or began to degrade them to the estate
of provincialisms.<a name="FNanchor_10_71" id="FNanchor_10_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_71" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> A curious phenomenon is presented by the
case of <i>maize</i>, which came into the colonial speech from some
West Indian dialect, went over into orthodox English, and from
English into French, German and other continental languages,
and was then abandoned by the colonists. We shall see other
examples of that process later on.</p>

<p>Whether or not <i>Yankee</i> comes from an Indian dialect is still
disputed. An early authority, John G. E. Heckwelder, argued
that it was derived from an Indian mispronunciation of the
word <i>English</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_72" id="FNanchor_11_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_72" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Certain later etymologists hold that it originated
more probably in an Indian mishandling of the French
word <i>Anglais</i>. Yet others derive it from the Scotch <i>yankie</i>,
meaning a gigantic falsehood. A fourth party derive it from
the Dutch, and cite an alleged Dutch model for "Yankee Doodle,"
beginning "<i>Yanker</i> didee doodle down."<a name="FNanchor_12_73" id="FNanchor_12_73"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_73" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Of these
theories that of Heckwelder is the most plausible. But here,
as in other directions, the investigation of American etymology
remains sadly incomplete. An elaborate dictionary of words
derived from the Indian languages, compiled by the late W. R.
Gerard, is in the possession of the Smithsonian Institution, but
on account of a shortage of funds it remains in manuscript. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg043"></a>[Pg043]</span></p>

<p>From the very earliest days of English colonization the language
of the colonists also received accretions from the languages
of the other colonizing nations. The French word <i>portage</i>, for
example, was already in common use before the end of the seventeenth
century, and soon after came <i>chowder</i>, <i>cache</i>, <i>caribou</i>,
<i>voyageur</i>, and various words that, like the last-named, have
since become localisms or disappeared altogether. Before 1750
<i>bureau</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_74" id="FNanchor_13_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_74" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> <i>gopher</i>, <i>batteau</i>, <i>bogus</i>, and <i>prairie</i> were added, and
<i>caboose</i>, a word of Dutch origin, seems to have come in through
the French. <i>Carry-all</i> is also French in origin, despite its English
quality. It comes, by the law of Hobson-Jobson, from the
French <i>carriole</i>. The contributions of the Dutch during the
half century of their conflicts with the English included <i>cruller</i>,
<i>cold-slaw</i>, <i>dominie</i> (for <i>parson</i>), <i>cookey</i>, <i>stoop</i>, <i>span</i> (of horses),
<i>pit</i> (as in <i>peach-pit</i>), <i>waffle</i>, <i>hook</i> (a point of land), <i>scow</i>, <i>boss</i>,
<i>smearcase</i> and <i>Santa Claus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_75" id="FNanchor_14_75"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_75" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Schele de Vere credits them with
<i>hay-barrack</i>, a corruption of <i>hooiberg</i>. That they established
the use of <i>bush</i> as a designation for back-country is very probable;
the word has also got into South African English. In
American it has produced a number of familiar derivatives, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>bush-whacker</i> and <i>bush-league</i>. Barrère and Leland also credit
the Dutch with <i>dander</i>, which is commonly assumed to be an
American corruption of <i>dandruff</i>. They say that it is from the
Dutch word <i>donder</i> (=<i>thunder</i>). <i>Op donderen</i>, in Dutch,
means to burst into a sudden rage. The chief Spanish contributions
to American were to come after the War of 1812, with
the opening of the West, but <i>creole</i>, <i>calaboose</i>, <i>palmetto</i>, <i>peewee</i>,
<i>key</i> (a small island), <i>quadroon</i>, <i>octoroon</i>, <i>barbecue</i>, <i>pickaninny</i>
and <i>stampede</i> had already entered the language in colonial days.
<i>Jerked beef</i> came from the Spanish <i>charqui</i> by the law of Hobson-Jobson.
The Germans who arrived in Pennsylvania in
1682 also undoubtedly gave a few words to the language, though <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg044"></a>[Pg044]</span>
it is often difficult to distinguish their contributions from those
of the Dutch. It seems very likely, however, that <i>sauerkraut</i><a name="FNanchor_15_76" id="FNanchor_15_76"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15_76" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and <i>noodle</i> are to be credited to them. Finally, the negro slaves
brought in <i>gumbo</i>, <i>goober</i>, <i>juba</i> and <i>voodoo</i> (usually corrupted
to <i>hoodoo</i>), and probably helped to corrupt a number of other
loan-words, for example <i>banjo</i> and <i>breakdown</i>. <i>Banjo</i> seems to
be derived from <i>bandore</i> or <i>bandurria</i>, modern French and Spanish
forms of <i>tambour</i>, respectively. It may, however, be an
actual negro word; there is a term of like meaning, <i>bania</i>, in
Senegambian. Ware says that <i>breakdown</i>, designating a riotous
negro dance, is a corruption of the French <i>rigadon</i>. The word
is not in the Oxford Dictionary. Bartlett listed it as an Americanism,
but Thornton rejected it, apparently because, in the sense
of a collapse, it has come into colloquial use in England. Its
etymology is not given in the American dictionaries.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 3</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="New_Words_of_English_Material"></a>New Words of English Material</h3>—But of far more importance
than these borrowings was the great stock of new words that the
colonists coined in English metal—words primarily demanded by
the "new circumstances under which they were placed," but also
indicative, in more than one case, of a delight in the business for
its own sake. The American, even in the early eighteenth century,
already showed many of the characteristics that were to set
him off from the Englishman later on—his bold and somewhat
grotesque imagination, his contempt for authority, his lack of
aesthetic sensitiveness, his extravagant humor. Among the first
colonists there were many men of education, culture and gentle
birth, but they were soon swamped by hordes of the ignorant
and illiterate, and the latter, cut off from the corrective influence
of books, soon laid their hands upon the language. It is impossible
to imagine the austere Puritan divines of Massachusetts
inventing such verbs as <i>to cowhide</i> and <i>to logroll</i>, or such adjectives
as <i>no-account</i> and <i>stumped</i>, or such adverbs as <i>no-how</i> and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg045"></a>[Pg045]</span>
<i>lickety-split</i>, or such substantives as <i>bull-frog</i>, <i>hog-wallow</i> and
<i>hoe-cake</i>; but under their eyes there arose a contumacious proletariat
which was quite capable of the business, and very eager
for it. In Boston, so early as 1628, there was a definite class of
blackguard roisterers, chiefly made up of sailors and artisans; in
Virginia, nearly a decade earlier, John Pory, secretary to Governor
Yeardley, lamented that "in these five moneths of my continuance
here there have come at one time or another eleven sails
of ships into this river, but fraighted more with ignorance than
with any other marchansize." In particular, the generation born
in the New World was uncouth and iconoclastic;<a name="FNanchor_16_77" id="FNanchor_16_77"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_77" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the only world
it knew was a rough world, and the virtues that environment engendered
were not those of niceness, but those of enterprise and
resourcefulness.</div>

<p>Upon men of this sort fell the task of bringing the wilderness
to the ax and the plow, and with it went the task of inventing a
vocabulary for the special needs of the great adventure. Out of
their loutish ingenuity came a great number of picturesque names
for natural objects, chiefly boldly descriptive compounds: <i>bull-frog</i>,
<i>canvas-back</i>, <i>lightning-bug</i>, <i>mud-hen</i>, <i>cat-bird</i>, <i>razor-back</i>,
<i>garter-snake</i>, <i>ground-hog</i> and so on. And out of an inventiveness
somewhat more urbane came such coinages as <i>live-oak</i>, <i>potato-bug</i>,
<i>turkey-gobbler</i>, <i>poke-weed</i>, <i>copper-head</i>, <i>eel-grass</i>, <i>reed-bird</i>,
<i>egg-plant</i>, <i>blue-grass</i>, <i>pea-nut</i>, <i>pitch-pine</i>, <i>cling-stone</i>
(peach), <i>moccasin-snake</i>, <i>June-bug</i> and <i>butter-nut</i>. <i>Live-oak</i>
appears in a document of 1610; <i>bull-frog</i> was familiar to Beverley
in 1705; so was <i>James-Town weed</i> (later reduced to <i>Jimson
weed</i>, as the English <i>hurtleberry</i> or <i>whortleberry</i> was reduced to
<i>huckleberry</i>). These early Americans were not botanists. They
were often ignorant of the names of the plants they encountered,
even when those plants already had English names, and so they
exercised their fancy upon new ones. So arose <i>Johnny-jump-up</i>
for the <i>Viola tricolor</i>, and <i>basswood</i> for the common European
<i>linden</i> or <i>lime-tree</i> (<i>Tilia</i>), and <i>locust</i> for the <i>Robinia pseudacacia</i>
and its allies. The <i>Jimson weed</i> itself was anything but a <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg046"></a>[Pg046]</span>
novelty, but the pioneers apparently did not recognize it, and so
we find them ascribing all sorts of absurd medicinal powers to it,
and even Beverley solemnly reporting that "some Soldiers, eating
it in a Salad, turn'd natural Fools upon it for several Days."
The grosser features of the landscape got a lavish renaming,
partly to distinguish new forms and partly out of an obvious
desire to attain a more literal descriptiveness. I have mentioned
<i>key</i> and <i>hook</i>, the one borrowed from the Spanish and the other
from the Dutch. With them came <i>run</i>, <i>branch</i>, <i>fork</i>, <i>bluff</i>,
(noun), <i>neck</i>, <i>barrens</i>, <i>bottoms</i>, <i>underbrush</i>, <i>bottom-land</i>, <i>clearing</i>,
<i>notch</i>, <i>divide</i>, <i>knob</i>, <i>riffle</i>, <i>gap</i>, <i>rolling-country</i> and <i>rapids</i>,<a name="FNanchor_17_78" id="FNanchor_17_78"></a><a
href="#Footnote_17_78" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and the extension of <i>pond</i> from artificial pools to small natural
lakes, and of <i>creek</i> from small arms of the sea to shallow feeders
of rivers. Such common English geographical terms as <i>downs</i>,
<i>weald</i>, <i>wold</i>, <i>fen</i>, <i>bog</i>, <i>fell</i>, <i>chase</i>, <i>combe</i>, <i>dell</i>, <i>heath</i> and <i>moor</i>
disappeared from the colonial tongue, save as fossilized in a few
proper names. So did <i>bracken</i>.</p>

<p>With the new landscape came an entirely new mode of life—new
foods, new forms of habitation, new methods of agriculture,
new kinds of hunting. A great swarm of neologisms thus arose,
and, as in the previous case, they were chiefly compounds.
<i>Back-country</i>, <i>back-woods</i>, <i>back-woodsman</i>, <i>back-settlers</i>, <i>back-settlements</i>:
all these were in common use early in the eighteenth
century. <i>Back-log</i> was used by Increase Mather in 1684. <i>Log-house</i>
appears in the Maryland Archives for 1669.<a name="FNanchor_18_79" id="FNanchor_18_79"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_79" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>Hoe-cake</i>,
<i>Johnny-cake</i>, <i>pan-fish</i>, <i>corn-dodger</i>, <i>roasting-ear</i>, <i>corn-crib</i>, <i>corn-cob</i>
and <i>pop-corn</i> were all familiar before the Revolution. So
were <i>pine-knot</i>, <i>snow-plow</i>, <i>cold-snap</i>, <i>land-slide</i>, <i>salt-lick</i>,
<i>prickly-heat</i>, <i>shell-road</i> and <i>cane-brake</i>. <i>Shingle</i> was a novelty
in 1705, but one S. Symonds wrote to John Winthrop, of Ipswich,
about a <i>clapboarded</i> house in 1637. <i>Frame-house</i> seems to have
come in with <i>shingle</i>. <i>Trail</i>, <i>half-breed</i>, <i>Indian-summer</i> and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg047"></a>[Pg047]</span>
<i>Indian-file</i> were obviously suggested by the Red Men. <i>State-house</i>
was borrowed, perhaps, from the Dutch. <i>Selectman</i> is first
heard of in 1685, displacing the English <i>alderman</i>. <i>Mush</i> had
displaced <i>porridge</i> by 1671. Soon afterward <i>hay-stack</i> took the
place of the English <i>hay-cock</i>, and such common English terms as
<i>byre</i>, <i>mews</i>, <i>weir</i>, and <i>wain</i> began to disappear. <i>Hired-man</i> is to
be found in the Plymouth town records of 1737, and <i>hired-girl</i>
followed soon after. So early as 1758, as we find by the diary of
Nathaniel Ames, the second-year students at Harvard were already
called <i>sophomores</i>, though for a while the spelling was
often made <i>sophimores</i>. <i>Camp-meeting</i> was later; it did not appear
until 1799. But <i>land-office</i> was familiar before 1700, and
<i>side-walk</i>, <i>spelling-bee</i>, <i>bee-line</i>, <i>moss-back</i>, <i>crazy-quilt</i>, <i>mud-scow</i>,
<i>stamping-ground</i> and a hundred and one other such compounds
were in daily use before the Revolution. After that
great upheaval the new money of the confederation brought in a
number of new words. In 1782 Gouverneur Morris proposed to
the Continental Congress that the coins of the republic be called,
in ascending order, <i>unit</i>, <i>penny-bill</i>, <i>dollar</i> and <i>crown</i>. Later
Morris invented the word <i>cent</i>, substituting it for the English
<i>penny</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_80" id="FNanchor_19_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_80" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In 1785 Jefferson proposed <i>mill</i>, <i>cent</i>, <i>dime</i>, <i>dollar</i> and
<i>eagle</i>, and this nomenclature was adopted.</p>

<p>Various nautical terms peculiar to America, or taken into English
from American sources, came in during the eighteenth century,
among them, <i>schooner</i>, <i>cat-boat</i> and <i>pungy</i>, not to recall
<i>batteau</i> and <i>canoe</i>. According to a recent historian of the American
merchant marine,<a name="FNanchor_20_81" id="FNanchor_20_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_81" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the first schooner ever seen was launched
at Gloucester, Mass., in 1713. The word, it appears, was originally
spelled <i>scooner</i>. <i>To scoon</i> was a verb borrowed by the
New Englanders from some Scotch dialect, and meant to skim
or skip across the water like a flat stone. As the first schooner
left the ways and glided out into Gloucester harbor, an enraptured
spectator shouted: "Oh, see how she scoons!" "A
<i>scooner</i> let her be!" replied Captain Andrew Robinson, her <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg048"></a>[Pg048]</span>
builder—and all boats of her peculiar and novel fore-and-aft rig
took the name thereafter. The Dutch mariners borrowed the
term and changed the spelling, and this change was soon accepted
in America. The Scotch root came from the Norse <i>skunna</i>, to
hasten, and there are analogues in Icelandic, Anglo-Saxon and
Old High German. The origin of <i>cat-boat</i> and <i>pungy</i> I have
been unable to determine. Perhaps the latter is related in some
way to <i>pung</i>, a one-horse sled or wagon. <i>Pung</i> was once widely
used in the United States, but of late it has sunk to the estate
of a New England provincialism. Longfellow used it, and in
1857 a writer in the <cite>Knickerbocker Magazine</cite> reported that <i>pungs</i>
filled Broadway, in New York, after a snow-storm.</p>

<p>Most of these new words, of course, produced derivatives, for
example, <i>to stack hay</i>, <i>to shingle</i>, <i>to shuck</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, corn), <i>to trail</i>
and <i>to caucus</i>. <i>Backwoods</i> immediately begat <i>backwoodsman</i>
and was itself turned into a common adjective. The colonists,
indeed, showed a beautiful disregard of linguistic nicety. At
an early date they shortened the English law-phrase, <i>to convey
by deed</i>, to the simple verb, <i>to deed</i>. Pickering protested against
this as a barbarism, and argued that no self-respecting law-writer
would employ it, but all the same it was firmly entrenched in the
common speech and it has remained there to this day. <i>To table</i>,
for <i>to lay on the table</i>, came in at the same time, and so did
various forms represented by <i>bindery</i>, for <i>bookbinder's shop</i>. <i>To
tomahawk</i> appeared before 1650, and <i>to scalp</i> must have followed
soon after. Within the next century and a half they were reinforced
by many other such new verbs, and by such adjectives
made of nouns as <i>no-account</i> and <i>one-horse</i>, and such nouns made
of verbs as <i>carry-all</i> and <i>goner</i>, and such adverbs as <i>no-how</i>. In
particular, the manufacture of new verbs went on at a rapid
pace. In his letter to Webster in 1789, Franklin denounced <i>to
advocate</i>, <i>to progress</i>, and <i>to oppose</i>—a vain enterprise, for all
of them are now in perfectly good usage. <i>To advocate</i>, indeed,
was used by Thomas Nashe in 1589, and by John Milton half a
century later, but it seems to have been reinvented in America.
In 1822 and again in 1838 Robert Southey, then poet laureate,
led two belated attacks upon it, as a barbarous Americanism, but <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg049"></a>[Pg049]</span>
its obvious usefulness preserved it, and it remains in good usage
on both sides of the Atlantic today—one of the earliest of the
English borrowings from America. In the end, indeed, even so
ardent a purist as Richard Grant White adopted it, as he did
<i>to placate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21_82" id="FNanchor_21_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_82" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Webster, though he agreed with Franklin in opposing <i>to advocate</i>,
gave his <i>imprimatur</i> to <i>to appreciate</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, to rise in value),
and is credited by Sir Charles Lyell<a name="FNanchor_22_83" id="FNanchor_22_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_83" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> with having himself invented
<i>to demoralize</i>. He also approved <i>to obligate</i>. <i>To antagonize</i>
seems to have been given currency by John Quincy Adams,
<i>to immigrate</i> by John Marshall, <i>to eventuate</i> by Gouverneur
Morris, and <i>to derange</i> by George Washington. Jefferson, always
hospitable to new words, used <i>to belittle</i> in his "Notes on
Virginia," and Thornton thinks that he coined it. Many new
verbs were made by the simple process of prefixing the preposition
to common nouns, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to clerk</i>, <i>to dicker</i>, <i>to dump</i>, <i>to blow</i>,
(<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, to bluster or boast), <i>to cord</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, wood) <i>to stump</i>, <i>to room</i>
and <i>to shin</i>. Others were made by transforming verbs in the
orthodox vocabulary, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to cavort</i> from <i>to curvet</i>, and <i>to snoop</i>
from <i>to snook</i>. Others arose as metaphors, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to whitewash</i>
(figuratively) and <i>to squat</i> (on unoccupied land). Others were
made by hitching suffixes to nouns, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to negative</i>, <i>to deputize</i>,
<i>to locate</i>, <i>to legislate</i>, <i>to infract</i>, <i>to compromit</i> and <i>to happify</i>.
Yet others seem to have been produced by onomatopoeia, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>to fizzle</i>, or to have arisen by some other such spontaneous process,
so far unintelligible, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to tote</i>. With them came an endless
series of verb-phrases, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to draw a bead</i>, <i>to face the music</i>,
<i>to darken one's doors</i>, <i>to take to the woods</i>, <i>to fly off the handle</i>,
<i>to go on the war-path</i> and <i>to saw wood</i>—all obvious products of
frontier life. Many coinages of the pre-Revolutionary era later
disappeared. Jefferson used <i>to ambition</i> but it dropped out
nevertheless, and so did <i>to compromit</i>, (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, to compromise), <i>to
homologize</i>, and <i>to happify</i>. Fierce battles raged 'round some of
these words, and they were all violently derided in England.
Even so useful a verb as <i>to locate</i>, now in perfectly good usage, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg050"></a>[Pg050]</span>
was denounced in the third volume of the <cite>North American Review</cite>,
and other purists of the times tried to put down <i>to legislate</i>.</p>

<p>The young and tender adjectives had quite as hard a row to
hoe, particularly <i>lengthy</i>. The <cite>British Critic</cite> attacked it in November,
1793, and it also had enemies at home, but John Adams
had used it in his diary in 1759 and the authority of Jefferson
and Hamilton was behind it, and so it survived. Years later
James Russell Lowell spoke of it as "the excellent adjective,"<a name="FNanchor_23_84" id="FNanchor_23_84"></a><a
href="#Footnote_23_84" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and boasted that American had given it to English. <i>Dutiable</i>
also met with opposition, and moreover, it had a rival, <i>customable</i>;
but Marshall wrote it into his historic decisions, and thus
it took root. The same anonymous watchman of the <cite>North
American Review</cite> who protested against <i>to locate</i> pronounced his
anathema upon "such barbarous terms as <i>presidential</i> and <i>congressional</i>,"
but the plain need for them kept them in the language.
<i>Gubernatorial</i> had come in long before this, and is to
be found in the New Jersey Archives of 1734. <i>Influential</i> was
denounced by the Rev. Jonathan Boucher and by George Canning,
who argued that <i>influent</i> was better, but it was ardently
defended by William Pinkney, of Maryland, and gradually made
its way. <i>Handy</i>, <i>kinky</i>, <i>law-abiding</i>, <i>chunky</i>, <i>solid</i> (in the sense
of well-to-do), <i>evincive</i>, <i>complected</i>, <i>judgmatical</i>, <i>underpinned</i>,
<i>blooded</i> and <i>cute</i> were also already secure in revolutionary days.
So with many nouns. Jefferson used <i>breadstuffs</i> in his Report
of the Secretary of State on Commercial Restrictions, December
16, 1793. <i>Balance</i>, in the sense of remainder, got into the debates
of the First Congress. <i>Mileage</i> was used by Franklin in
1754, and is now sound English. <i>Elevator</i>, in the sense of a
storage house for grain, was used by Jefferson and by others
before him. <i>Draw</i>, for <i>drawbridge</i>, comes down from Revolutionary
days. So does <i>slip</i>, in the sense of a berth for vessels.
So does <i>addition</i>, in the sense of a suburb. So, finally, does
<i>darkey</i>.</p>

<p>The history of many of these Americanisms shows how vain is
the effort of grammarians to combat the normal processes of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg051"></a>[Pg051]</span>
language development. I have mentioned the early opposition to
<i>dutiable</i>, <i>influential</i>, <i>presidential</i>, <i>lengthy</i>, <i>to locate</i>, <i>to oppose</i>, <i>to
advocate</i>, <i>to legislate</i> and <i>to progress</i>. <i>Bogus</i>, <i>reliable</i> and <i>standpoint</i>
were attacked with the same academic ferocity. All of
them are to be found in Bryant's <cite>Index Expurgatorius</cite><a name="FNanchor_24_85" id="FNanchor_24_85"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24_85" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> (<i class="abblatin">circa</i>
1870), and <i>reliable</i> was denounced by Bishop Coxe as "that abominable
barbarism" so late as 1886.<a name="FNanchor_25_86" id="FNanchor_25_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_86" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Edward S. Gould, another
uncompromising purist, said of <i>standpoint</i> that it was "the
bright particular star ... of solemn philological blundering"
and "the very counterpart of Dogberry's <i>non-com</i>."<a name="FNanchor_26_87" id="FNanchor_26_87"></a><a
href="#Footnote_26_87" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Gould
also protested against <i>to jeopardize</i>, <i>leniency</i> and <i>to demean</i>,
and Richard Grant White joined him in an onslaught upon <i>to
donate</i>. But all of these words are in good use in the United
States today, and some of them have gone over into English.<a name="FNanchor_27_88" id="FNanchor_27_88"></a><a

<p class="ph3number">§ 4</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Changed_Meanings"></a>Changed Meanings</h3>—A number of the foregoing contributions
to the American vocabulary, of course, were simply common
English words with changed meanings. <i>To squat</i>, in the sense of
<i>to crouch</i>, had been sound English for centuries; what the colonists
did was to attach a figurative meaning to it, and then bring
that figurative meaning into wider usage than the literal meaning.
In a somewhat similar manner they changed the significance
of <i>pond</i>, as I have pointed out. So, too, with <i>creek</i>. In
English it designated (and still designates) a small inlet or arm
of a large river or of the sea; in American, so early as 1674, it
designated any small stream. Many other such changed meanings
crept into American in the early days. A typical one was
the use of <i>lot</i> to designate a <i>parcel</i> of land. Thornton says, perhaps
inaccurately, that it originated in the fact that the land in
New England was distributed by lot. Whatever the truth, <i>lot</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg052"></a>[Pg052]</span>
to this day, is in almost universal use in the United States, though
rare in England. Our conveyancers, in describing real property,
always speak of "all that <i>lot</i> or <i>parcel</i> of land."<a name="FNanchor_28_89" id="FNanchor_28_89"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_89" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Other
examples of the application of old words to new purposes are
afforded by <i>freshet</i>, <i>barn</i> and <i>team</i>. A <i>freshet</i>, in eighteenth
century English, meant any stream of fresh water; the colonists
made it signify an inundation. A <i>barn</i> was a house or shed for
storing crops; in the colonies the word came to mean a place for
keeping cattle also. A <i>team</i>, in English, was a pair of draft
horses; in the colonies it came to mean both horses and vehicle.</div>

<p>The process is even more clearly shown in the history of such
words as <i>corn</i> and <i>shoe</i>. <i>Corn</i>, in orthodox English, means grain
for human consumption, and especially wheat, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, the <i>Corn</i>
Laws. The earliest settlers, following this usage, gave the name
of <i>Indian corn</i> to what the Spaniards, following the Indians
themselves, had called <i>maíz</i>. But gradually the adjective fell
off, and by the middle of the eighteenth century <i>maize</i> was called
simply <i>corn</i>, and grains in general were called <i>breadstuffs</i>.
Thomas Hutchinson, discoursing to George III in 1774, used <i>corn</i>
in this restricted sense, speaking of "rye and <i>corn</i> mixed."
"What <i>corn</i>?" asked George. "<i>Indian corn</i>," explained Hutchinson,
"or, as it is called in authors, <i>maize</i>."<a name="FNanchor_29_90" id="FNanchor_29_90"></a><a
href="#Footnote_29_90" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> So with <i>shoe</i>.
In English it meant (and still means) a topless article of foot-wear,
but the colonists extended its meaning to varieties covering
the ankle, thus displacing the English <i>boot</i>, which they reserved
for foot coverings reaching at least to the knee. To designate
the English <i>shoe</i> they began to use the word <i>slipper</i>. This distinction
between English and American usage still prevails, despite
the affectation which has lately sought to revive <i>boot</i>, and
with it its derivatives, <i>boot-shop</i> and <i>bootmaker</i>.</p>

<p><i>Store</i>, <i>shop</i>, <i>lumber</i>, <i>pie</i>, <i>dry-goods</i>, <i>cracker</i>, <i>rock</i> and <i>partridge</i>
among nouns and <i>to haul</i>, <i>to jew</i>, <i>to notify</i> and <i>to heft</i> among
verbs offer further examples of changed meanings. Down to the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg053"></a>[Pg053]</span>
middle of the eighteenth century <i>shop</i> continued to designate a
retail establishment in America, as it does in England to this
day. <i>Store</i> was applied only to a large establishment—one showing,
in some measure, the character of a warehouse. But in 1774
a Boston young man was advertising in the <cite>Massachusetts Spy</cite>
for "a <i>place</i> as a <i>clerk</i> in a <i>store</i>" (three Americanisms in a
row!). Soon afterward <i>shop</i> began to acquire its special American
meaning as a factory, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>machine-shop</i>. Meanwhile <i>store</i>
completely displaced <i>shop</i> in the English sense, and it remained
for a late flowering of Anglomania, as in the case of <i>boot</i> and
<i>shoe</i>, to restore, in a measure, the <i class="abblatin">status quo ante</i>. <i>Lumber</i>, in
eighteenth century English, meant disused furniture, and this is
its common meaning in England today. But the colonists early
employed it to designate timber, and that use of it is now universal
in America. Its familiar derivatives, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>lumber-yard</i>,
<i>lumberman</i>, <i>lumberjack</i>, greatly reinforce this usage. <i>Pie</i>, in
English, means a meat-pie; in American it means a fruit-pie.
The English call a fruit-pie a <i>tart</i>; the Americans call a meat-pie
a <i>pot-pie</i>. <i>Dry-goods</i>, in England, means "non-liquid goods,
as corn" (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, wheat); in the United States the term means
"textile fabrics or wares."<a name="FNanchor_30_91" id="FNanchor_30_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_91" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The difference had appeared before
1725. <i>Rock</i>, in English, always means a large mass; in
America it may mean a small stone, as in <i>rock-pile</i> and <i>to throw
a rock</i>. The Puritans were putting <i>rocks</i> into the foundations
of their meeting-houses so early as 1712.<a name="FNanchor_31_92" id="FNanchor_31_92"></a><a
href="#Footnote_31_92" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> <i>Cracker</i> began to be
used for <i>biscuit</i> before the Revolution. <i>Tavern</i> displaced <i>inn</i> at
the same time. As for <i>partridge</i>, it is cited by a late authority<a name="FNanchor_32_93" id="FNanchor_32_93"></a><a
href="#Footnote_32_93" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
as a salient example of changed meaning, along with <i>corn</i> and
<i>store</i>. In England the term is applied only to the true partridge
(<i class="abblatin">Perdix perdix</i>) and its nearly related varieties, but in the United
States it is also used to designate the ruffed grouse (<i class="abblatin">Bonasa
umbellus</i>), the common quail (<i class="abblatin">Colinus virginianus</i>) and various <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg054"></a>[Pg054]</span>
other tetraonoid birds. This confusion goes back to colonial
times. So with <i>rabbit</i>. Properly speaking, there are no native
rabbits in the United States; they are all hares. But the early
colonists, for some unknown reason, dropped the word <i>hare</i> out
of their vocabulary, and it is rarely heard in American speech
to this day. When it appears it is almost always applied to the
so-called Belgian hare, which, curiously enough, is not a hare at
all, but a true rabbit.</p>

<p><i>To haul</i>, in English, means to move by force or violence; in
the colonies it came to mean to transport in a vehicle, and this
meaning survives in sound American. <i>To jew</i>, in English, means
to cheat; the colonists made it mean to haggle, and devised <i>to jew
down</i> to indicate an effort to work a reduction in price. <i>To heft</i>,
in English, means to lift; the early Americans made it mean to
weigh by lifting, and kept the idea of weighing in its derivatives,
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>hefty</i>. Finally, there is the familiar American misuse of
<i>Miss</i> or <i>Mis'</i> for <i>Mrs.</i>. It was so widespread by 1790 that on
November 17 of that year Webster solemnly denounced it in the
<cite>American Mercury</cite>.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 5</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Archaic_English_Words"></a>Archaic
English Words</h3>—Most of the colonists who lived along
the American seaboard in 1750 were the descendants of immigrants
who had come in fully a century before; after the first
settlements there had been much less fresh immigration than
many latter-day writers have assumed. According to Prescott
F. Hall, "the population of New England ... at the date of
the Revolutionary War ... was produced out of an immigration
of about 20,000 persons <em>who arrived before 1640</em>,"<a name="FNanchor_33_94" id="FNanchor_33_94"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_94" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and we
have Franklin's authority for the statement that the total population
of the colonies in 1751, then about 1,000,000, had been <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg055"></a>[Pg055]</span>
produced from an original immigration of less than 80,000.<a name="FNanchor_34_95" id="FNanchor_34_95"></a><a
href="#Footnote_34_95" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Even at that early day, indeed, the colonists had begun to feel
that they were distinctly separated, in culture and customs, from
the mother-country,<a name="FNanchor_35_96" id="FNanchor_35_96"></a><a
href="#Footnote_35_96" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and there were signs of the rise of a new
native aristocracy, entirely distinct from the older aristocracy of
the royal governors' courts.<a name="FNanchor_36_97" id="FNanchor_36_97"></a><a
href="#Footnote_36_97" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The enormous difficulties of communication
with England helped to foster this sense of separation.
The round trip across the ocean occupied the better part
of a year, and was hazardous and expensive; a colonist who had
made it was a marked man,—as Hawthorne said, "the <i
class="abblatin">petit-maître</i>
of the colonies." Nor was there any very extensive exchange
of ideas, for though most of the books read in the colonies
came from England, the great majority of the colonists, down to
the middle of the century, seem to have read little save the Bible
and biblical commentaries, and in the native literature of the
time one seldom comes upon any reference to the English authors
who were glorifying the period of the Restoration and the reign
of Anne. Moreover, after 1760 the colonial eyes were upon
France rather than upon England, and Rousseau, Montesquieu,
Voltaire and the Encyclopedists began to be familiar names to
thousands who were scarcely aware of Addison and Steele, or
even of the great Elizabethans.<a name="FNanchor_37_98"
id="FNanchor_37_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_98"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a></div>

<p>The result of this isolation, on the one hand, was that proliferation
of the colonial speech which I have briefly reviewed, and on
the other hand, the preservation of many words and phrases that
gradually became obsolete in England. The Pilgrims of 1620
brought over with them the English of James I and the Revised <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg056"></a>[Pg056]</span>
Version, and their descendants of a century later, inheriting it,
allowed its fundamentals to be little changed by the academic
overhauling that the mother tongue was put to during the early
part of the eighteenth century. In part they were ignorant of
this overhauling, and in part they were indifferent to it. Whenever
the new usage differed from that of the Bible they were inclined
to remain faithful to the Bible, not only because of its
pious authority but also because of the superior pull of its imminent
and constant presence. Thus when an artificial prudery in
English ordered the abandonment of the Anglo-Saxon <i>sick</i> for
the Gothic <i>ill</i>, the colonies refused to follow, for <i>sick</i> was in both
the Old Testament and the New;<a name="FNanchor_38_99" id="FNanchor_38_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_99" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and that refusal remains in
force to this day.</p>

<p>A very large number of words and phrases, many of them now
exclusively American, are similar survivals from the English of
the seventeenth century, long since obsolete or merely provincial
in England. Among nouns Thornton notes <i>fox-fire</i>, <i>flap-jack</i>,
<i>jeans</i>, <i>molasses</i>, <i>beef</i> (to designate the live animal), <i>chinch</i>, <i>cord-wood</i>,
<i>homespun</i>, <i>ice-cream</i>, <i>julep</i> and <i>swingle-tree</i>; Halliwell<a name="FNanchor_39_100" id="FNanchor_39_100"></a><a
href="#Footnote_39_100" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
adds <i>andiron</i>, <i>bay-window</i>, <i>cesspool</i>, <i>clodhopper</i>, <i>cross-purposes</i>,
<i>greenhorn</i>, <i>loophole</i>, <i>ragamuffin</i>, <i>riff-raff</i>, <i>rigmarole</i> and <i>trash</i>;
and other authorities cite <i>stock</i> (for cattle), <i>fall</i> (for autumn),
<i>offal</i>, <i>din</i>, <i>underpinning</i> and <i>adze</i>. <i>Bub</i>, used in addressing a
boy, is very old English, but survives only in American. <i>Flap-jack</i>
goes back to Piers Plowman, but has been obsolete in England
for two centuries. <i>Muss</i>, in the sense of a row, is also obsolete
over there, but it is to be found in "Anthony and Cleopatra."
<i>Char</i>, as a noun, disappeared from English a long time ago, but
it survives in American as <i>chore</i>. Among the adjectives similarly
preserved are <i>to whittle</i>, <i>to wilt</i> and <i>to approbate</i>. <i>To guess</i>, in
the American sense of <i>to suppose</i>, is to be found in "Henry
VI": <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg057"></a>[Pg057]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
Not all together; better far, I <i>guess</i>,<br />
That we do make our entrance several ways.<br />
</div>

<p>In "Measure for Measure" Escalus says "I <i>guess</i> not" to
Angelo. The New English Dictionary offers examples much
older—from Chaucer, Wyclif and Gower. <i>To interview</i> is in
Dekker. <i>To loan</i>, in the American sense of to lend, is in 34 and
35 Henry VIII, but it dropped out of use in England early in
the eighteenth century, and all the leading dictionaries, both
English and American, now call it an Americanism.<a name="FNanchor_40_101" id="FNanchor_40_101"></a><a
href="#Footnote_40_101" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i>To fellowship</i>,
once in good American use but now reduced to a provincialism,
is in Chaucer. Even <i>to hustle</i>, it appears, is ancient.
Among adjectives, <i>homely</i>, which means only homelike or unadorned
in England, was used in its American sense of plain-featured
by both Shakespeare and Milton. Other such survivors
are <i>burly</i>, <i>catty-cornered</i>, <i>likely</i>, <i>deft</i>, <i>copious</i>, <i>scant</i> and
<i>ornate</i>. Perhaps <i>clever</i> also belongs to this category, that is, in
the American sense of amiable.</p>

<p>"Our ancestors," said James Russell Lowell, "unhappily could
bring over no English better than Shakespeare's." Shakespeare
died in 1616; the Pilgrims landed four years later;
Jamestown was founded in 1607. As we have seen, the colonists,
saving a few superior leaders, were men of small sensitiveness
to the refinements of life and speech: soldiers of fortune, amateur
theologians, younger sons, neighborhood "advanced thinkers,"
bankrupts, jobless workmen, decayed gentry, and other such
fugitives from culture—in brief, Philistines of the sort who join
tin-pot fraternal orders today, and march in parades, and whoop
for the latest mountebanks in politics. There was thus a touch
of rhetoric in Lowell's saying that they spoke the English of
Shakespeare; as well argue that the London grocers of 1885
spoke the English of Pater. But in a larger sense he said truly,
for these men at least brought with them the vocabulary of
Shakespeare—or a part of it,—even if the uses he made of it
were beyond their comprehension, and they also brought with <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg058"></a>[Pg058]</span>
them that sense of ease in the language, that fine disdain for
formality, that bold experimentalizing in words, which was so
peculiarly Elizabethan. There were no grammarians in that
day; there were no purists that anyone listened to; it was a
case of saying your say in the easiest and most satisfying way.
In remote parts of the United States there are still direct and
almost pure-blooded descendants of those seventeenth century
colonists. Go among them, and you will hear more words from
the Shakespearean vocabulary, still alive and in common service,
than anywhere else in the world, and more of the loose and
brilliant syntax of that time, and more of its gipsy phrases.<a name="FNanchor_41_102" id="FNanchor_41_102"></a><a

<p class="ph3number">§ 6</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Colonial_Pronunciation"></a>Colonial Pronunciation</h3>—The debate that long raged over the
pronunciation of classical Latin exhibits the difficulty of determining
with exactness the shades of sound in the speech of
a people long departed from earth. The American colonists,
of course, are much nearer to us than the Romans, and so we
should have relatively little difficulty in determining just how
they pronounced this or that word, but against the fact of their
nearness stands the neglect of our philologists, or, perhaps more
accurately, our lack of philologists. What Sweet did to clear
up the history of English pronunciation,<a name="FNanchor_42_103" id="FNanchor_42_103"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42_103" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and what Wilhelm
Corssen did for Latin, no American professor has yet thought
to attempt for American. The literature is almost, if not quite
a blank. But here and there we may get a hint of the facts, and
though the sum of them is not large, they at least serve to set
at rest a number of popular errors.</div>

<p>One of these errors, chiefly prevalent in New England, is
that the so-called Boston pronunciation, with its broad <i>a</i>'s (making
<i>last</i>, <i>path</i> and <i>aunt</i> almost assonant with <i>bar</i>) comes down
unbrokenly from the day of the first settlements, and that it is
in consequence superior in authority to the pronunciation of the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg059"></a>[Pg059]</span>
rest of the country, with its flat <i>a</i>'s (making the same words
assonant with <i>ban</i>). A glance through Webster's "Dissertations"
is sufficient to show that the flat <i>a</i> was in use in New
England in 1789, for the pronunciation of such words as <i>wrath</i>,
<i>bath</i> and <i>path</i>, as given by him, makes them rhyme with <i>hath</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_104" id="FNanchor_43_104"></a><a
href="#Footnote_43_104" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Moreover, he gives <i>aunt</i> the same <i>a</i>-sound. From other sources
come indications that the <i>a</i> was likewise flattened in such words
as <i>plant</i>, <i>basket</i>, <i>branch</i>, <i>dance</i>, <i>blast</i>, <i>command</i> and <i>castle</i>, and
even in <i>balm</i> and <i>calm</i>. Changes in the sound of the letter have
been going on in English ever since the Middle English period,<a name="FNanchor_44_105" id="FNanchor_44_105"></a><a
href="#Footnote_44_105" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and according to Lounsbury<a name="FNanchor_45_106" id="FNanchor_45_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_106" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> they have moved toward the disappearance
of the Continental <i>a</i>, "the fundamental vowel-tone
of the human voice." Grandgent, another authority,<a name="FNanchor_46_107" id="FNanchor_46_107"></a><a
href="#Footnote_46_107" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> says
that it became flattened "by the sixteenth century" and that
"until 1780 or thereabouts the standard language had no broad
<i>a</i>." Even in such words as <i>father</i>, <i>car</i> and <i>ask</i> the flat <i>a</i> was
universally used. Sheridan, in the dictionary he published in
1780,<a name="FNanchor_47_108" id="FNanchor_47_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_108" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> actually gave no <i>ah</i>-sound in his list of vowels. This
habit of flatting the <i>a</i> had been brought over, of course, by the
early colonists, and was as general in America, in the third
quarter of the eighteenth century, as in England. Benjamin
Franklin, when he wrote his "Scheme for a New Alphabet and
a Reformed Mode of Spelling," in 1768, apparently had no suspicion
that any other <i>a</i> was possible. But between 1780 and
1790, according to Grandgent, a sudden fashion for the broad <i>a</i>
(not the <i>aw</i>-sound, as in <i>fall</i>, but the Continental sound as in
<i>far</i>) arose in England,<a name="FNanchor_48_109" id="FNanchor_48_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_109" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and this fashion soon found servile
imitation in Boston. But it was as much an affectation in those <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg060"></a>[Pg060]</span>
days as it is today, and Webster indicated the fact pretty plainly
in his "Dissertations." How, despite his opposition, the broad
<i>a</i> prevailed East of the Connecticut river, and how, in the end,
he himself yielded to it, and even tried to force it upon the
whole nation—this will be rehearsed in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The colonists remained faithful much longer than the English
to various other vowel-sounds that were facing change in
the eighteenth century, for example, the long <i>e</i>-sound in <i>heard</i>.
Webster says that the custom of rhyming <i>heard</i> with <i>bird</i> instead
of with <i>feared</i> came in at the beginning of the Revolution.
"To most people in this country," he adds, "the English
pronunciation appears like affectation." He also argues for
rhyming <i>deaf</i> with <i>leaf</i>, and protests against inserting a <i>y</i>-sound
before the <i>u</i> in such words as <i>nature</i>. Franklin's authority
stands behind <i>git</i> for <i>get</i>. This pronunciation, according to
Menner,<a name="FNanchor_49_110" id="FNanchor_49_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_110" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> was correct in seventeenth century England, and perhaps
down to the middle of the next century. So was the use
of the Continental <i>i</i>-sound in <i>oblige</i>, making it <i>obleege</i>. It is
probable that the colonists clung to these disappearing usages
much longer than the English. The latter, according to Webster,
were unduly responsive to illogical fashions set by the
exquisites of the court and by popular actors. He blames Garrick,
in particular, for many extravagant innovations, most of
them not followed in the colonies. But Garrick was surely not
responsible for the use of a long <i>i</i>-sound in such words as <i>motive</i>,
nor for the corruption of <i>mercy</i> to <i>marcy</i>. Webster denounced
both of these barbarisms. The second he ascribed somewhat
lamely to the fact that the letter <i>r</i> is called <i>ar</i>, and proposed to
dispose of it by changing the <i>ar</i> to <i>er</i>.</p>

<p>As for the consonants, the colonists seem to have resisted
valiantly that tendency to slide over them which arose in England
after the Restoration. Franklin, in 1768, still retained the
sound of <i>l</i> in such words as <i>would</i> and <i>should</i>, a usage not met
with in England after the year 1700. In the same way, according
to Menner, the <i>w</i> in <i>sword</i> was sounded in America "for
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg061"></a><span class="hidden">[Pg061]</span></span>
some time after Englishmen had abandoned it." The sensitive
ear of Henry James detected an unpleasant <i>r</i>-sound in the
speech of Americans, long ago got rid of by the English, so
late as 1905; he even charged that it was inserted gratuitously
in innocent words.<a name="FNanchor_50_111" id="FNanchor_50_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_111" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The obvious slurring of the consonants by
Southerners is explained by a recent investigator<a name="FNanchor_51_112" id="FNanchor_51_112"></a><a
href="#Footnote_51_112" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> on the ground
that it began in England during the reign of Charles II, and
that most of the Southern colonists came to the New World
at that time. The court of Charles, it is argued, was under
French influence, due to the king's long residence in France and
his marriage to Henrietta Marie. Charles "objected to the inharmonious
contractions <i>will'nt</i> (or <i>wolln't</i>) and <i>wasn't</i> and
<i>weren't</i> ... and set the fashion of using the softly euphonious
<i>won't</i> and <i>wan't</i>, which are used in speaking to this day by the
best class of Southerners." A more direct French influence
upon Southern pronunciation is also pointed out. "With full
knowledge of his <i>g's</i> and his <i>r's</i>, ... [the Southerner] sees fit
to glide over them, ... and he carries over the consonant ending
one word to the vowel beginning the next, just as the Frenchman
does." The political importance of the South, in the years
between the Mecklenburg Declaration and the adoption of the
Constitution, tended to force its provincialisms upon the common
language. Many of the acknowledged leaders of the nascent
nation were Southerners, and their pronunciation, as well as
their phrases, must have become familiar everywhere. Pickering
gives us a hint, indeed, at the process whereby their usage
influenced that of the rest of the people.<a name="FNanchor_52_113" id="FNanchor_52_113"></a><a
href="#Footnote_52_113" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The Americans early dropped the <i>h</i>-sound in such words as
<i>when</i> and <i>where</i>, but so far as I can determine they never elided
it at the beginning of words, save in the case of <i>herb</i>, and a few
others. This elision is commonly spoken of as a cockney vulgarism,
but it has extended to the orthodox English speech. In
<i>ostler</i> the initial <i>h</i> is openly left off; in <i>hotel</i> and <i>hospital</i> it is <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg062"></a>[Pg062]</span>
seldom sounded, even by the most careful Englishmen. Certain
English words in <i>h</i>, in which the <i>h</i> is now sounded, betray
its former silence by the fact that not <i>a</i> but <i>an</i> is still put before
them. It is still good English usage to write <i>an hotel</i> and <i>an
historical</i>; it is the American usage to write <i>a hotel</i> and <i>a historical</i>.</p>

<p>The great authority of Webster was sufficient to establish the
American pronunciation of <i>schedule</i>. In England the <i>sch</i> is
always given the soft sound, but Webster decided for the hard
sound, as in <i>scheme</i>. The variance persists to this day. The
name of the last letter of the alphabet, which is always <i>zed</i> in
English, is usually made <i>zee</i> in the United States. Thornton
shows that this Americanism arose in the eighteenth century.</p>

The Period of Growth</h2>

<p class="ph3number">§ 1</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_New_Nation"></a>The New Nation</h3>—The
 American language thus began to be
recognizably differentiated from English in both vocabulary and
pronunciation by the opening of the nineteenth century, but as
yet its growth was hampered by two factors, the first being the
lack of a national literature of any pretentions and the second
being an internal political disharmony which greatly conditioned
and enfeebled the national consciousness. During the
actual Revolution common aims and common dangers forced
the Americans to show a united front, but once they had
achieved political independence they developed conflicting interests,
and out of those conflicting interests came suspicions and
hatreds which came near wrecking the new confederation more
than once. Politically, their worst weakness, perhaps, was an
inability to detach themselves wholly from the struggle for domination
still going on in Europe. The surviving Loyalists of
the revolutionary era—estimated by some authorities to have
constituted fully a third of the total population in 1776—were
ardently in favor of England, and such patriots as Jefferson
were as ardently in favor of France. This engrossment in the
quarrels of foreign nations was what Washington warned against
in his Farewell Address. It was at the bottom of such bitter
animosities as that between Jefferson and Hamilton. It inspired
and perhaps excused the pessimism of such men as Burr.
Its net effect was to make it difficult for the people of the new
nation to think of themselves, politically, as Americans. Their
state of mind, vacillating, uncertain, alternately timorous and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg064"></a>[Pg064]</span>
pugnacious, has been well described by Henry Cabot Lodge in
his essay on "Colonialism in America."<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id="FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Soon after the Treaty
of Paris was signed, someone referred to the late struggle, in
Franklin's hearing, as the War for Independence. "Say,
rather, the War of the Revolution," said Franklin. "The War
for Independence is yet to be fought."</div>

<p>"That struggle," adds Lossing, "occurred, and that independence
was won, by the Americans in the War of 1812."<a name="FNanchor_2_115" id="FNanchor_2_115"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2_115" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In the interval the new republic had passed through a period of
<i class="abblatin">Sturm und Drang</i> whose gigantic perils and passions we have
begun to forget—a period in which disaster ever menaced, and
the foes within were no less bold and pertinacious than the foes
without. Jefferson, perhaps, carried his fear of "monocrats" to
the point of monomania, but under it there was undoubtedly a
body of sound fact. The poor debtor class (including probably
a majority of the veterans of the Revolution) had been fired by
the facile doctrines of the French Revolution to demands which
threatened the country with bankruptcy and anarchy, and the
class of property-owners, in reaction, went far to the other extreme.
On all sides, indeed, there flourished a strong British
party, and particularly in New England, where the so-called
codfish aristocracy (by no means extinct, even today) exhibited
an undisguised Anglomania, and looked forward confidently to
a <i class="abblatin">rapprochement</i> with the mother
country.<a name="FNanchor_3_116" id="FNanchor_3_116"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_116" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This Anglomania
showed itself, not only in ceaseless political agitation, but also
in an elaborate imitation of English manners. We have already
seen, on Noah Webster's authority, how it even extended to the
pronunciation of the language.</p>

<p>The first sign of the dawn of a new national order came
with the election of Thomas Jefferson to the Presidency in 1800.
The issue in the campaign was a highly complex one, but under
it lay a plain conflict between democratic independence and the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg065"></a>[Pg065]</span>
old doctrine of dependence and authority; and with the Alien
and Sedition Laws about his neck, so vividly reminiscent of the
issues of the Revolution itself, Adams went down to defeat.
Jefferson was violently anti-British and pro-French; he saw all
the schemes of his political opponents, indeed, as English plots;
he was the man who introduced the bugaboo into American politics.
His first acts after his inauguration were to abolish all
ceremonial at the court of the republic, and to abandon spoken
discourses to Congress for written messages. That ceremonial,
which grew up under Washington, was an imitation, he believed,
of the formality of the abhorrent Court of St. James;
as for the speeches to Congress, they were palpably modelled
upon the speeches from the throne of the English kings. Both
reforms met with wide approval; the exactions of the English,
particularly on the high seas, were beginning to break up the
British party. But confidence in the solidarity and security
of the new nation was still anything but universal. The surviving
doubts, indeed, were strong enough to delay the ratification
of the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, providing
for more direct elections of President and Vice-President, until
the end of 1804, and even then three of the five New England
states rejected it,<a name="FNanchor_4_117" id="FNanchor_4_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_117" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and have never ratified it, in fact, to this
day. Democracy was still experimental, doubtful, full of gunpowder.
In so far as it had actually come into being, it had
come as a boon conferred from above. Jefferson, its protagonist,
was the hero of the populace, but he was not of the populace
himself, nor did he ever quite trust it.</p>

<p>It was reserved for Andrew Jackson, a man genuinely of the
people, to lead and visualize the rise of the lower orders. Jackson,
in his way, was the archetype of the new American—ignorant,
pushful, impatient of restraint and precedent, an iconoclast,
a Philistine, an Anglophobe in every fibre. He came
from the extreme backwoods and his youth was passed amid
surroundings but little removed from downright savagery.<a name="FNanchor_5_118" id="FNanchor_5_118"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5_118" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg066"></a>[Pg066]</span>
Thousands of other young Americans like him were growing up
at the same time—youngsters filled with a vast impatience of all
precedent and authority, revilers of all that had come down
from an elder day, incorrigible libertarians. They swarmed
across the mountains and down the great rivers, wrestling with
the naked wilderness and setting up a casual, impromptu sort
of civilization where the Indian still menaced. Schools were
few and rudimentary; there was not the remotest approach to
a cultivated society; any effort to mimic the amenities of the
East, or of the mother country, in manner or even in speech,
met with instant derision. It was in these surroundings and
at this time that the thorough-going American of tradition was
born: blatant, illogical, elate, "greeting the embarrassed gods"
uproariously and matching "with Destiny for beers." Jackson
was unmistakably of that company in his every instinct and
idea, and it was his fate to give a new and unshakable confidence
to its aspiration at the Battle of New Orleans. Thereafter all
doubts began to die out; the new republic was turning out a
success. And with success came a vast increase in the national
egoism. The hordes of pioneers rolled down the western valleys
and on to the great plains.<a name="FNanchor_6_119" id="FNanchor_6_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_119" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> America began to stand for something
quite new in the world—in government, in law, in public
and private morals, in customs and habits of mind, in the
minutia of social intercourse. And simultaneously the voice of
America began to take on its characteristic twang, and the speech
of America began to differentiate itself boldly and unmistakably
from the speech of England. The average Philadelphian
or Bostonian of 1790 had not the slightest difficulty in making
himself understood by a visiting Englishman. But the average
Ohio boatman of 1810 or plainsman of 1815 was already speaking
a dialect that the Englishman would have shrunk from as
barbarous and unintelligible, and before long it began to leave <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg067"></a>[Pg067]</span>
its mark upon and to get direction and support from a distinctively
national literature.</p>

<p>That literature, however, was very slow in coming to a dignified,
confident and autonomous estate. Down to Jefferson's day
it was almost wholly polemical, and hence lacking in the finer
values; he himself, an insatiable propagandist and controversialist,
was one of its chief ornaments. "The novelists and the
historians, the essayists and the poets, whose names come to mind
when American literature is mentioned," says a recent literary
historian, "have all flourished since 1800."<a name="FNanchor_7_120" id="FNanchor_7_120"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_120" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Pickering, so late
as 1816, said that "in this country we can hardly be said to have
any authors by profession." It was a true saying, though the
new day was about to dawn; Bryant had already written
"Thanatopsis" and was destined to publish it the year following.
Difficulties of communication hampered the circulation of
the few native books that were written; it was easier for a man
in the South to get books from London than to get them from
Boston or New York, and the lack of a copyright treaty with
England flooded the country with cheap English editions. "It
is much to be regretted," wrote Dr. David Ramsay, of Charleston,
S. C., to Noah Webster in 1806, "that there is so little intercourse
in a literary way between the states. As soon as a book
of general utility comes out in any state it should be for sale
in all of them." Ramsay asked for little; the most he could
imagine was a sale of 2,000 copies for an American work in
America. But even that was far beyond the possibilities of the
time.</p>

<p>An external influence of great potency helped to keep the
national literature scant and timorous during those early and
perilous days. It was the extraordinary animosity of the English
critics, then at the zenith of their pontifical authority, to
all books of American origin or flavor. This animosity, culminating
in Sydney Smith's famous sneer,<a name="FNanchor_8_121" id="FNanchor_8_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_121" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was but part of a <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg068"></a>[Pg068]</span>
larger hostility to all things American, from political theories
to table manners. The American, after the war of 1812, became
the pet abomination of the English, and the chief butt of
the incomparable English talent for moral indignation. There
was scarcely an issue of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>,
the <cite>Foreign Quarterly</cite>, the <cite>British Review</cite> or <cite>Blackwood's</cite>, for
a generation following 1814, in which he was not stupendously
assaulted. Gifford, Sydney Smith and the poet Southey became
specialists in this business; it took on the character of a
holy war; even such mild men as Wordsworth were recruited
for it. It was argued that the Americans were rogues and
swindlers, that they lived in filth and squalor, that they were
boors in social intercourse, that they were poltroons and savages
in war, that they were depraved and criminal, that they were
wholly devoid of the remotest notion of decency or honor. The
<cite>Foreign Quarterly</cite>, summing up in January, 1844, pronounced
them "horn-handed and pig-headed, hard, persevering, unscrupulous,
carnivorous, with a genius for lying." Various Americans
went to the defense of their countrymen, among them,
Irving, Cooper, Timothy Dwight, J. K. Paulding, John Neal,
Edward Everett and Robert Walsh. Paulding, in "John Bull
in America, or, the New Munchausen," published in 1825, attempted
satire. Even an Englishman, James Sterling, warned
his fellow-Britons that, if they continued their intolerant abuse,
they would "turn into bitterness the last drops of good-will
toward England that exist in the United States." But the
avalanche of denunciation kept up, and even down to a few
years ago it was very uncommon for an Englishman to write of
American politics, or manners, or literature without betraying
his dislike. Not, indeed, until the Prussian began monopolizing
the whole British talent for horror and invective did the Yankee
escape the lash.<a name="FNanchor_9_122" id="FNanchor_9_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_122" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>This gigantic pummelling, in the long run, was destined to
encourage an independent spirit in the national literature, if <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg069"></a>[Pg069]</span>
only by a process of mingled resentment and despair, but for
some time its chief effect was to make American writers of a
more delicate aspiration extremely self-conscious and diffident.
The educated classes, even against their will, were influenced
by the torrent of abuse; they could not help finding in it an
occasional reasonableness, an accidental true hit. The result,
despite the efforts of Channing, Knapp and other such valiant
defenders of the native author, was uncertainty and skepticism
in native criticism. "The first step of an American entering
upon a literary career," says Lodge, writing of the first quarter
of the century, "was to pretend to be an Englishman in order
that he might win the approval, not of Englishmen, but of his
own countrymen." Cooper, in his first novel, "Precaution,"
chose an English scene, imitated English models, and obviously
hoped to placate the critics thereby. Irving, too, in his earliest
work, showed a considerable discretion, and his "History of
New York," as everyone knows, was first published anonymously.
But this puerile spirit did not last long. The English onslaughts
were altogether too vicious to be received lying down;
their very fury demanded that they be met with a united and
courageous front. Cooper, in his second novel, "The Spy,"
boldly chose an American setting and American characters, and
though the influence of his wife, who came of a Loyalist family,
caused him to avoid any direct attack upon the English, he attacked
them indirectly, and with great effect, by opposing an
immediate and honorable success to their derisions. "The Spy"
ran through three editions in four months; it was followed by
his long line of thoroughly American novels; in 1834 he formally
apologized to his countrymen for his early truancy in
"Precaution." Irving, too, soon adopted a bolder tone, and
despite his English predilections, he refused an offer of a hundred
guineas for an article for the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, made by
Gifford in 1828, on the ground that "the <cite>Review</cite> has been so
persistently hostile to our country that I cannot draw a pen in
its service."</p>

<p>The same year saw the publication of the first edition of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg070"></a>[Pg070]</span>
Webster's American Dictionary of the English language, and a
year later followed Samuel L. Knapp's "Lectures on American
Literature," the first history of the national letters ever attempted.
Knapp, in his preface, thought it necessary to prove,
first of all, that an American literature actually existed, and
Webster, in his introduction, was properly apologetic, but there
was no real need for timorousness in either case, for the American
attitude toward the attack of the English was now definitely
changing from uneasiness to defiance. The English critics, in
fact, had overdone the thing, and though their clatter was to
keep up for many years more, they no longer spread terror
or had much influence. Of a sudden, as if in answer to them,
doubts turned to confidence, and then into the wildest sort of
optimism, not only in politics and business, but also in what
passed for the arts. Knapp boldly defied the English to produce
a "tuneful sister" surpassing Mrs. Sigourney; more, he
argued that the New World, if only by reason of its superior
scenic grandeur, would eventually hatch a poetry surpassing
even that of Greece and Rome. "What are the Tibers and
Scamanders," he demanded, "measured by the Missouri and the
Amazon? Or what the loveliness of Illysus or Avon by the
Connecticut or the Potomack?"</p>

<p>In brief, the national feeling, long delayed at birth, finally
leaped into being in amazing vigor. "One can get an idea of
the strength of that feeling," says R. O. Williams, "by glancing
at almost any book taken at random from the American publications
of the period. Belief in the grand future of the United
States is the key-note of everything said and done. All things
American are to be grand—our territory, population, products,
wealth, science, art—but especially our political institutions and
literature. The unbounded confidence in the material development
of the country which now characterizes the extreme northwest
of the United States prevailed as strongly throughout the
eastern part of the Union during the first thirty years of the
century; and over and above a belief in, and concern for, materialistic
progress, there were enthusiastic anticipations of
achievements in all the moral and intellectual fields of national <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg071"></a>[Pg071]</span>
greatness."<a name="FNanchor_10_123" id="FNanchor_10_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_123" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Nor was that vast optimism wholly without warrant.
An American literature was actually coming into being,
and with a wall of hatred and contempt shutting in England,
the new American writers were beginning to turn to the Continent
for inspiration and encouragement. Irving had already
drunk at Spanish springs; Emerson and Bayard Taylor were
to receive powerful impulses from Germany, following Ticknor,
Bancroft and Everett before them; Bryant was destined to go
back to the classics. Moreover, Cooper and John P. Kennedy
had shown the way to native sources of literary material, and
Longfellow was making ready to follow them; novels in imitation
of English models were no longer heard of; the ground
was preparing for "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Finally, Webster
himself, as Williams demonstrated, worked better than he knew.
His American Dictionary was not only thoroughly American:
it was superior to any of the current dictionaries of the English,
so much so that for a good many years it remained "a sort of
mine for British lexicography to exploit."</p>

<p>Thus all hesitations disappeared, and there arose a national
consciousness so soaring and so blatant that it began to dismiss
all British usage and opinion as puerile and idiotic. William
L. Marcy, when Secretary of State under Pierce (1853-57),
issued a circular to all American diplomatic and consular officers,
loftily bidding them employ only "the American language"
in communicating with him. The Legislature of Indiana,
in an act approved February 15, 1838, establishing the
state university at Bloomington,<a name="FNanchor_11_124" id="FNanchor_11_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_124" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> provided that it should instruct
the youth of the new commonwealth (it had been admitted
to the Union in 1816) "in the American, learned and foreign
languages ... and literature." Such grandiose pronunciamentos <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg072"></a>[Pg072]</span>
well indicate and explain the temper of the era.<a name="FNanchor_12_125" id="FNanchor_12_125"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_125" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It was
a time of expansion and braggadocia. The new republic would
not only produce a civilization and a literature of its own; it
would show the way for all other civilizations and literatures.
Rufus Wilmot Griswold, the enemy of Poe, rose from his
decorous Baptist pew to protest that so much patriotism
amounted to insularity and absurdity, but there seems to have
been no one to second the motion. It took, indeed, the vast
shock of the Civil War to unhorse the optimists. While the
Jackson influence survived, it was the almost unanimous national
conviction that "he who dallies is a dastard, and he who
doubts is damned."</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 2</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Language_in_the_Making"></a>The Language in the Making</h3>—All this jingoistic bombast,
however, was directed toward defending, not so much the national
vernacular as the national beautiful letters. True enough,
an English attack upon a definite American locution always
brought out certain critical minute-men, but in the main they
were anything but hospitable to the racy neologisms that kept
crowding up from below, and most of them were eager to be
accepted as masters of orthodox English and very sensitive to
the charge that their writing was bestrewn with Americanisms.
A glance through the native criticism of the time will show
how ardently even the most uncompromising patriots imitated
the Johnsonian jargon then fashionable in England. Fowler
and Griswold followed pantingly in the footsteps of Macaulay;
their prose is extraordinarily ornate and self-conscious, and one
searches it in vain for any concession to colloquialism. Poe, the
master of them all, achieved a style so elephantine that many
an English leader-writer must have studied it with envy. A
few bolder spirits, as we have seen, spoke out for national freedom
in language as well as in letters—among them, Channing—but
in the main the Brahmins of the time were conservatives in <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg073"></a>[Pg073]</span>
that department, and it is difficult to imagine Emerson or Irving
or Bryant sanctioning the innovations later adopted so easily
by Howells. Lowell and Walt Whitman, in fact, were the first
men of letters, properly so called, to give specific assent to the
great changes that were firmly fixed in the national speech during
the half century between the War of 1812 and the Civil
War. Lowell did so in his preface to the second series of "The
Biglow Papers." Whitman made his declaration in "An American
Primer." In discussing his own poetry, he said: "It is
an attempt to give the spirit, the body and the man, new words,
new potentialities of speech—an American, a cosmopolitan (for
the best of America is the best cosmopolitanism) range of self-expression."
And then: "The Americans are going to be the
most fluent and melodious-voiced people in the world—and the
most perfect users of words. The new times, the new people,
the new vistas need a new tongue according—yes, and what
is more, they will have such a new tongue." To which, as everyone
knows, Whitman himself forthwith contributed many daring
(and still undigested) novelties, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>camerado</i>, <i>romanza</i>,
<i>Adamic</i> and <i>These States</i>.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, in strong contrast to the lingering conservatism
above there was a wild and lawless development of the language
below, and in the end it forced itself into recognition, and
profited by the literary declaration of independence of its very
opponents. "The <i class="abblatin">jus et norma loquendi</i>," says W. R. Morfill,
the English philologist, "do not depend upon scholars." Particularly
in a country where scholarship is still new and wholly
cloistered, and the overwhelming majority of the people are
engaged upon novel and highly exhilarating tasks, far away
from schools and with a gigantic cockiness in their hearts. The
remnants of the Puritan civilization had been wiped out by the
rise of the proletariat under Jackson, and whatever was fine and
sensitive in it had died with it. What remained of an urbane
habit of mind and utterance began to be confined to the narrowing
feudal areas of the south, and to the still narrower refuge
of the Boston Brahmins, now, for the first time, a definitely
recognized caste of <i class="abblatin">intelligentsia</i>, self-charged with carrying the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg074"></a>[Pg074]</span>
torch of culture through a new Dark Age. The typical American,
in Paulding's satirical phrase, became "a bundling, gouging,
impious" fellow, without either "morals, literature, religion
or refinement." Next to the savage struggle for land and
dollars, party politics was the chief concern of the people, and
with the disappearance of the old leaders and the entrance of
pushing upstarts from the backwoods, political controversy sank
to an incredibly low level. Bartlett, in the introduction to the
second edition of his Glossary, describes the effect upon the language.
First the enfranchised mob, whether in the city wards
or along the western rivers, invented fantastic slang-words and
turns of phrase; then they were "seized upon by stump-speakers
at political meetings"; then they were heard in Congress;
then they got into the newspapers; and finally they came into
more or less good usage. Much contemporary evidence is to the
same effect. Fowler, in listing "low expressions" in 1850, described
them as "chiefly political." "The vernacular tongue
of the country," said Daniel Webster, "has become greatly vitiated,
depraved and corrupted by the style of the congressional
debates." Thornton, in the appendix to his Glossary, gives
some astounding specimens of congressional oratory between the
20's and 60's, and many more will reward the explorer who
braves the files of the <cite>Congressional Globe</cite>. This flood of racy
and unprecedented words and phrases beat upon and finally
penetrated the retreat of the <i class="abblatin">literati</i>, but the purity of speech
cultivated there had little compensatory influence upon the vulgate.
The newspaper was now enthroned, and <i class="abblatin">belles lettres</i>
were cultivated almost in private, and as a mystery. It is probable,
indeed, that "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and "Ten Nights in
a Bar-room," both published in the early 50's, were the first
contemporary native books, after Cooper's day, that the American
people, as a people, ever read. Nor did the pulpit, now
fast falling from its old high estate, lift a corrective voice. On
the contrary, it joined the crowd, and Bartlett denounces it specifically
for its bad example, and cites, among its crimes against
the language, such inventions as <i>to doxologize</i> and <i>to funeralize</i>. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg075"></a>[Pg075]</span>
To these novelties, apparently without any thought of their uncouthness,
Fowler adds to <i>missionate</i> and <i>consociational</i>.</p>

<p>As I say, the pressure from below broke down the defenses
of the purists, and literally forced a new national idiom upon
them. Pen in hand, they might still achieve laborious imitations
of Johnson and Macaulay, but their mouths began to betray
them. "When it comes to talking," wrote Charles Astor
Bristed for Englishmen in 1855, "the most refined and best
educated American, who has habitually resided in his own country,
the very man who would write, on some serious topic, volumes
in which no peculiarity could be detected, will, in half a
dozen sentences, use at least as many words that cannot fail to
strike the inexperienced Englishman who hears them for the
first time." Bristed gave a specimen of the American of that
time, calculated to flabbergast his inexperienced Englishman;
you will find it in the volume of Cambridge Essays, already cited.
His aim was to explain and defend Americanisms, and so shut
off the storm of English reviling, and he succeeded in producing
one of the most thoughtful and persuasive essays on the subject
ever written. But his purpose failed and the attack kept up,
and eight years afterward the Very Rev. Henry Alford, D.D.,
dean of Canterbury, led a famous assault. "Look at those
phrases," he said, "which so amuse us in their speech and
books; at their reckless exaggeration and contempt for congruity;
and then compare the character and history of the nation—its
blunted sense of moral obligation and duty to man;
its open disregard of conventional right where aggrandizement
is to be obtained; and I may now say, its reckless and fruitless
maintenance of the most cruel and unprincipled war in the history
of the world."<a name="FNanchor_13_126" id="FNanchor_13_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_126" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In his American edition of 1866 Dr.
Alford withdrew this reference to the Civil War and somewhat
ameliorated his indignation otherwise, but he clung to the main
counts in his indictment, and most Englishmen, I daresay, still
give them a certain support. The American is no longer a <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg076"></a>[Pg076]</span>
"vain, egotistical, insolent, rodomontade sort of fellow"; America
is no longer the "brigand confederation" of the <cite>Foreign
Quarterly</cite> or "the loathsome creature, ... maimed and lame,
full of sores and ulcers" of Dickens; but the Americanism is yet
regarded with a bilious eye, and pounced upon viciously when
found. Even the friendliest English critics seem to be daunted
by the gargantuan copiousness of American inventions in speech.
Their position, perhaps, was well stated by Capt. Basil Hall,
author of the celebrated "Travels in North America," in 1827.
When he argued that "surely such innovations are to be deprecated,"
an American asked him this question: "If a word becomes
universally current in America, why should it not take
its station in the language?" "Because," replied Hall in all
seriousness, "there are words enough in our language already."</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Expanding_Vocabulary"></a>The Expanding Vocabulary</h3>—A glance at some of the characteristic
coinages of the time, as they are revealed in the <cite>Congressional
Globe</cite>, in contemporary newspapers and political tracts,
and in that grotesque small literature of humor which began
with Judge Thomas C. Haliburton's "Sam Slick" in 1835, is
almost enough to make one sympathize with Dean Alford. Bartlett
quotes <i>to doxologize</i> from the <cite>Christian Disciple</cite>, a quite
reputable religious paper of the 40's. <i>To citizenize</i> was used
and explained by Senator Young, of Illinois, in the Senate on
February 1, 1841, and he gave Noah Webster as authority for
it. <i>To funeralize</i> and <i>to missionate</i>, along with <i>consociational</i>,
were contributions of the backwoods pulpit; perhaps it also produced
<i>hell-roaring</i> and <i>hellion</i>, the latter of which was a favorite
of the Mormons and even got into a sermon by Henry Ward
Beecher. <i>To deacon</i>, a verb of decent mien in colonial days,
signifying to read a hymn line by line, responded to the rough
humor of the time, and began to mean to swindle or adulterate,
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, to put the largest berries at the top of the box, to extend
one's fences <i>sub rosa</i>, or to mix sand with sugar. A great rage
for extending the vocabulary by the use of suffixes seized upon <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg077"></a>[Pg077]</span>
the corn-fed etymologists, and they produced a formidable new
vocabulary in <i>-ize</i>, <i>-ate</i>, <i>-ify</i>, <i>-acy</i>, <i>-ous</i> and <i>-ment</i>. Such inventions
as <i>to obligate</i>, <i>to concertize</i>, <i>to questionize</i>, <i>retiracy</i>, <i>savagerous</i>,
<i>coatee</i> (a sort of diminutive for coat) and <i>citified</i> appeared
in the popular vocabulary, and even got into more or less
good usage. Fowler, in 1850, cited <i>publishment</i> and <i>releasement</i>
with no apparent thought that they were uncouth. And
at the same time many verbs were made by the simple process
of back formation, as, <i>to resurrect</i>, <i>to excurt</i>, <i>to resolute</i>, <i>to burgle</i><a name="FNanchor_14_127" id="FNanchor_14_127"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_127" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and <i>to enthuse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_128" id="FNanchor_15_128"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15_128" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></div>

<p>Some of these inventions, after flourishing for a generation
or more, were retired with blushes during the period of aesthetic
consciousness following the Civil War, but a large number have
survived to our own day, and are in good usage. Not even the
most bilious purist would think of objecting to <i>to affiliate</i>, <i>to
itemize</i>, <i>to resurrect</i> or <i>to Americanize</i> today, and yet all of
them gave grief to the judicious when they first appeared in the
debates of Congress, brought there by statesmen from the backwoods.
Nor to such simpler verbs of the period as <i>to corner</i>
(<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, the market), <i>to boss</i> and <i>to lynch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_129" id="FNanchor_16_129"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_129" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Nor perhaps to <i>to
boom</i>, <i>to boost</i>, <i>to kick</i> (in the sense of to protest), <i>to coast</i> (on
a sled), <i>to engineer</i>, <i>to collide</i>, <i>to chink</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, logs), <i>to feaze</i>, <i>to
splurge</i>, <i>to aggravate</i> (in the sense of to anger), <i>to yank</i> and
<i>to crawfish</i>. These verbs have entered into the very fibre of the
American vulgate, and so have many nouns derived from them,
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>boomer</i>, <i>boom-town</i>, <i>bouncer</i>, <i>kicker</i>, <i>kick</i>, <i>splurge</i>, <i>roller-coaster</i>.
A few of them, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to collide</i> and <i>to feaze</i>, were <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg078"></a>[Pg078]</span>
archaic English terms brought to new birth; a few others, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>to holler</i><a name="FNanchor_17_130" id="FNanchor_17_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_130" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and <i>to muss</i>, were obviously mere corruptions. But
a good many others, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to bulldoze</i>, <i>to hornswoggle</i> and <i>to
scoot</i>, were genuine inventions, and redolent of the soil.</p>

<p>With the new verbs came a great swarm of verb-phrases,
some of them short and pithy and others extraordinarily elaborate,
but all showing the true national talent for condensing a
complex thought, and often a whole series of thoughts, into a
vivid and arresting image. Of the first class are <i>to fill the bill</i>,
<i>to fizzle out</i>, <i>to make tracks</i>, <i>to peter out</i>, <i>to plank down</i>, <i>to go
back on</i>, <i>to keep tab</i>, <i>to light out</i> and <i>to back water</i>. Side by
side with them we have inherited such common coins of speech
as <i>to make the fur fly</i>, <i>to cut a swath</i>, <i>to know him like a book</i>,
<i>to keep a stiff upper lip</i>, <i>to cap the climax</i>, <i>to handle without
gloves</i>, <i>to freeze on to</i>, <i>to go it blind</i>, <i>to pull wool over his eyes</i>,
<i>to know the ropes</i>, <i>to get solid with</i>, <i>to spread one's self</i>, <i>to run
into the ground</i>, <i>to dodge the issue</i>, <i>to paint the town red</i>, <i>to
take a back seat</i> and <i>to get ahead of</i>. These are so familiar that
we use them and hear them without thought; they seem as authentically
parts of the English idiom as <i>to be left at the post</i>.
And yet, as the labors of Thornton have demonstrated, all of
them are of American nativity, and the circumstances surrounding
the origin of some of them have been accurately determined.
Many others are palpably the products of the great movement
toward the West, for example, <i>to pan out</i>, <i>to strike it rich</i>, <i>to
jump</i> or <i>enter a claim</i>, <i>to pull up stakes</i>, <i>to rope in</i>, <i>to die with
one's boots on</i>, <i>to get the deadwood on</i>, <i>to get the drop</i>, <i>to back
and fill</i> (a steamboat phrase used figuratively) and <i>to get the
bulge on</i>. And in many others the authentic American is no
less plain, for example, in <i>to kick the bucket</i>, <i>to put a bug in his <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg079"></a>[Pg079]</span>
ear</i>, <i>to see the elephant</i>, <i>to crack up</i>, <i>to do up brown</i>, <i>to bark
up the wrong tree</i>, <i>to jump on with both feet</i>, <i>to go the whole
hog</i>, <i>to make a kick</i>, <i>to buck the tiger</i>, <i>to let it slide</i> and <i>to come
out at the little end of the horn</i>. <i>To play possum</i> belongs to this
list. To it Thornton adds <i>to knock into a cocked hat</i>, despite its
English sound, and <i>to have an ax to grind</i>. <i>To go for</i>, both in
the sense of belligerency and in that of partisanship, is also
American, and so is <i>to go through</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, to plunder).</p>

<p>Of adjectives the list is scarcely less long. Among the coinages
of the first half of the century that are in good use today
are <i>non-committal</i>, <i>highfalutin</i>, <i>well-posted</i>, <i>down-town</i>, <i>played-out</i>,
<i>flat-footed</i>, <i>whole-souled</i> and <i>true-blue</i>. The first appears
in a Senate debate of 1841; <i>highfalutin</i> in a political speech of
the same decade. Both are useful words; it is impossible, not
employing them, to convey the ideas behind them without circumlocution.
The use of <i>slim</i> in the sense of meagre, as in <i>slim
chance</i>, <i>slim attendance</i> and <i>slim support</i>, goes back still further.
The English use <i>small</i> in place of it. Other, and less respectable
contributions of the time are <i>brash</i>, <i>brainy</i>, <i>peart</i>, <i>locoed</i>, <i>pesky</i>,
<i>picayune</i>, <i>scary</i>, <i>well-heeled</i>, <i>hardshell</i> (<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, Baptist), <i>low-flung</i>,
<i>codfish</i> (to indicate opprobrium) and <i>go-to-meeting</i>. The use
of <i>plumb</i> as an adjective, as in <i>plumb crazy</i>, is an English
archaism that was revived in the United States in the early years
of the century. In the more orthodox adverbial form of <i>plump</i>
it still survives, for example, in "she fell <i>plump</i> into his arms."
But this last is also good English.</p>

<p>The characteristic American substitution of <i>mad</i> for <i>angry</i>
goes back to the eighteenth century, and perhaps denotes the
survival of an English provincialism. Witherspoon noticed it
and denounced it in 1781, and in 1816 Pickering called it "low"
and said that it was not used "except in very familiar conversation."
But it got into much better odor soon afterward, and
by 1840 it passed unchallenged. Its use is one of the peculiarities
that Englishmen most quickly notice in American colloquial
speech today. In formal written discourse it is less often encountered,
probably because the English marking of it has so
conspicuously singled it out. But it is constantly met with <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg080"></a>[Pg080]</span>
in the newspapers and in the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>, and it is not
infrequently used by such writers as Howells and Dreiser. In
the familiar simile, <i>as mad as a hornet</i>, it is used in the American
sense. But <i>as mad as a March hare</i> is English, and connotes
insanity, not mere anger. The English meaning of the
word is preserved in <i>mad-house</i> and <i>mad-dog</i>, but I have often
noticed that American rustics, employing the latter term, derive
from it a vague notion, not that the dog is demented, but
that it is in a simple fury. From this notion, perhaps, comes
the popular belief that dogs may be thrown into hydrophobia by
teasing and badgering them.</p>

<p>It was not, however, among the verbs and adjectives that the
American word-coiners of the first half of the century achieved
their gaudiest innovations, but among the substantives. Here
they had temptation and excuse in plenty, for innumerable new
objects and relations demanded names, and here they exercised
their fancy without restraint. Setting aside loan words, which
will be considered later, three main varieties of new nouns were
thus produced. The first consisted of English words rescued
from obsolescence or changed in meaning, the second of compounds
manufactured of the common materials of the mother
tongue, and the third of entirely new inventions. Of the first
class, good specimens are <i>deck</i> (of cards), <i>gulch</i>, <i>gully</i> and
<i>billion</i>, the first three old English words restored to usage in
America and the last a sound English word changed in meaning.
Of the second class, examples are offered by <i>gum-shoe</i>,
<i>mortgage-shark</i>, <i>dug-out</i>, <i>shot-gun</i>, <i>stag-party</i>, <i>wheat-pit</i>, <i>horse-sense</i>,
<i>chipped-beef</i>, <i>oyster-supper</i>, <i>buzz-saw</i>, <i>chain-gang</i> and
<i>hell-box</i>. And of the third there are instances in <i>buncombe</i>,
<i>greaser</i>, <i>conniption</i>, <i>bloomer</i>, <i>campus</i>, <i>galoot</i>, <i>maverick</i>, <i>roustabout</i>,
<i>bugaboo</i> and <i>blizzard</i>.</p>

<p>Of these coinages, perhaps those of the second class are most
numerous and characteristic. In them American exhibits one
of its most marked tendencies: a habit of achieving short cuts
in speech by a process of agglutination. Why explain laboriously,
as an Englishman might, that the notes of a new bank (in
a day of innumerable new banks) are insufficiently secure? Call <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg081"></a>[Pg081]</span>
them <i>wild-cat</i> notes and have done! Why describe a gigantic
rain storm with the lame adjectives of everyday? Call it a
<i>cloud-burst</i> and immediately a vivid picture of it is conjured
up. <i>Rough-neck</i> is a capital word; it is more apposite and
savory than the English <i>navvy</i>, and it is overwhelmingly more
American.<a name="FNanchor_18_131" id="FNanchor_18_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_131" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>Square-meal</i> is another. <i>Fire-eater</i> is yet another.
And the same instinct for the terse, the eloquent and the
picturesque is in <i>boiled-shirt</i>, <i>blow-out</i>, <i>big-bug</i>, <i>claim-jumper</i>,
<i>spread-eagle</i>, <i>come-down</i>, <i>back-number</i>, <i>claw-hammer</i> (coat), <i>bottom-dollar</i>,
<i>poppy-cock</i>, <i>cold-snap</i>, <i>back-talk</i>, <i>back-taxes</i>, <i>calamity-howler</i>,
<i>cut-off</i>, <i>fire-bug</i>, <i>grab-bag</i>, <i>grip-sack</i>, <i>grub-stake</i>, <i>pay-dirt</i>,
<i>tender-foot</i>, <i>stocking-feet</i>, <i>ticket-scalper</i>, <i>store-clothes</i>, <i>small-potatoes</i>,
<i>cake-walk</i>, <i>prairie-schooner</i>, <i>round-up</i>, <i>snake-fence</i>, <i>flat-boat</i>,
<i>under-the-weather</i>, <i>on-the-hoof</i>, and <i>jumping-off-place</i>.
These compounds (there must be thousands of them) have been
largely responsible for giving the language its characteristic
tang and color. Such specimens as <i>bell-hop</i>, <i>semi-occasional</i>,
<i>chair-warmer</i> and <i>down-and-out</i> are as distinctively American
as baseball or the quick-lunch.</p>

<p>The spirit of the language appears scarcely less clearly in
some of the coinages of the other classes. There are, for example,
the English words that have been extended or restricted in
meaning, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>docket</i> (for court calendar), <i>betterment</i> (for improvement
to property), <i>collateral</i> (for security), <i>crank</i> (for
fanatic), <i>jumper</i> (for tunic), <i>tickler</i> (for memorandum or reminder),<a name="FNanchor_19_132" id="FNanchor_19_132"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_132" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
<i>carnival</i> (in such phrases as <i>carnival of crime</i>), <i>scrape</i>
(for fight or difficulty),<a name="FNanchor_20_133" id="FNanchor_20_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_133" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <i>flurry</i> (of snow, or in the market), <i>suspenders</i>,
<i>diggings</i> (for habitation) and <i>range</i>. Again, there are
the new assemblings of English materials, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>doggery</i>, <i>rowdy</i>,
<i>teetotaler</i>, <i>goatee</i>, <i>tony</i> and <i>cussedness</i>. Yet again, there are the
purely artificial words, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>sockdolager</i>, <i>hunkydory</i>, <i>scalawag</i>,
<i>guyascutis</i>, <i>spondulix</i>, <i>slumgullion</i>, <i>rambunctious</i>, <i>scrumptious</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg082"></a>[Pg082]</span>
<i>to skedaddle</i>, <i>to absquatulate</i> and <i>to exfluncticate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21_134" id="FNanchor_21_134"></a><a
href="#Footnote_21_134" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In the use
of the last-named coinages fashions change. In the 40's <i>to
absquatulate</i> was in good usage, but it has since disappeared.
Most of the other inventions of the time, however, have to some
extent survived, and it would be difficult to find an American of
today who did not know the meaning of <i>scalawag</i> and <i>rambunctious</i>
and who did not occasionally use them. A whole series of
artificial American words groups itself around the prefix <i>ker</i>,
for example, <i>ker-flop</i>, <i>ker-splash</i>, <i>ker-thump</i>, <i>ker-bang</i>, <i>ker-plunk</i>,
<i>ker-slam</i> and <i>ker-flummux</i>. This prefix and its onomatopoeic
daughters have been borrowed by the English, but Thornton and
Ware agree that it is American. Its origin has not been determined.
As Sayce says, "the native instinct of language
breaks out wherever it has the chance, and coins words which
can be traced back to no ancestors."</p>

<p>In the first chapter I mentioned the superior imaginativeness
revealed by Americans in meeting linguistic emergencies,
whereby, for example, in seeking names for new objects introduced
by the building of railroads, they surpassed the English
<i>plough</i> and <i>crossing-plate</i> with <i>cow-catcher</i> and <i>frog</i>. That was
in the 30's. Already at that early day the two languages were
so differentiated that they produced wholly distinct railroad
nomenclatures. Such commonplace American terms as <i>box-car</i>,
<i>caboose</i>, <i>air-line</i> and <i>ticket-agent</i> are still quite unknown in England.
So are <i>freight-car</i>, <i>flagman</i>, <i>towerman</i>, <i>switch</i>, <i>switching-engine</i>,
<i>switch-yard</i>, <i>switchman</i>, <i>track-walker</i>, <i>engineer</i>, <i>baggage-room</i>,
<i>baggage-check</i>, <i>baggage-smasher</i>, <i>accommodation-train</i>,
<i>baggage-master</i>, <i>conductor</i>, <i>express-car</i>, <i>flat-car</i>, <i>hand-car</i>, <i>way-bill</i>,
<i>expressman</i>, <i>express-office</i>, <i>fast-freight</i>, <i>wrecking-crew</i>, <i>jerk-water</i>,
<i>commutation-ticket</i>, <i>commuter</i>, <i>round-trip</i>, <i>mileage-book</i>,
<i>ticket-scalper</i>, <i>depot</i>, <i>limited</i>, <i>hot-box</i>, iron-horse, <i>stop-over</i>, <i>tie</i>,
<i>rail</i>, <i>fish-plate</i>, <i>run</i>, <i>train-boy</i>, <i>chair-car</i>, <i>club-car</i>, <i>diner</i>, <i>sleeper</i>,
<i>bumpers</i>, <i>mail-clerk</i>, <i>passenger-coach</i>, <i>day-coach</i>, <i>excursionist</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg083"></a>[Pg083]</span>
<i>excursion-train</i>, <i>railroad-man</i>, <i>ticket-office</i>, <i>truck</i> and <i>right-of-way</i>,
not to mention the verbs, <i>to flag</i>, <i>to derail</i>, <i>to express</i>, <i>to
dead-head</i>, <i>to side-swipe</i>, <i>to stop-over</i>, <i>to fire</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, a locomotive),
<i>to switch</i>, <i>to side-track</i>, <i>to railroad</i>, <i>to commute</i>, <i>to telescope</i> and
<i>to clear the track</i>. These terms are in constant use in America;
their meaning is familiar to all Americans; many of them have
given the language everyday figures of speech.<a name="FNanchor_22_135" id="FNanchor_22_135"></a><a
href="#Footnote_22_135" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But the majority
of them would puzzle an Englishman, just as the English
<i>luggage-van</i>, <i>permanent-way</i>, <i>goods-waggon</i>, <i>guard</i>, <i>carrier</i>,
<i>booking-office</i>, <i>return-ticket</i>, <i>railway-rug</i>, <i>R. S. O.</i> (railway sub-office),
<i>tripper</i>, <i>line</i>, <i>points</i>, <i>shunt</i>, <i>metals</i> and <i>bogie</i> would puzzle
the average untravelled American.</p>

<p>In two other familiar fields very considerable differences between
English and American are visible; in both fields they go
back to the era before the Civil War. They are politics and
that department of social intercourse which has to do with drinking.
Many characteristic American political terms originated
in revolutionary days, and have passed over into English. Of
such sort are <i>caucus</i> and <i>mileage</i>. But the majority of those in
common use today were coined during the extraordinarily exciting
campaigns following the defeat of Adams by Jefferson.
Charles Ledyard Norton has devoted a whole book to their
etymology and meaning;<a name="FNanchor_23_136" id="FNanchor_23_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_136" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the number is far too large for a
list of them to be attempted here. But a few characteristic
specimens may be recalled, for example, the simple agglutinates:
<i>omnibus-bill</i>, <i>banner-state</i>, <i>favorite-son</i>, <i>anxious-bench</i>, <i>gag-rule</i>,
<i>office-seeker</i> and <i>straight-ticket</i>; the humorous metaphors: <i>pork-barrel</i>,
<i>pie-counter</i>, <i>wire-puller</i>, <i>land-slide</i>, <i>carpet-bagger</i>, <i>lame-duck</i>
and <i>on the fence</i>; the old words put to new uses: <i>plank</i>,
<i>platform</i>, <i>machine</i>, <i>precinct</i>, <i>slate</i>, <i>primary</i>, <i>floater</i>, <i>repeater</i>,
<i>bolter</i>, <i>stalwart</i>, <i>filibuster</i>, <i>regular</i> and <i>fences</i>; the new coinages:
<i>gerrymander</i>, <i>heeler</i>, <i>buncombe</i>, <i>roorback</i>, <i>mugwump</i> and
<i>to bulldoze</i>; the new derivatives: <i>abolitionist</i>, <i>candidacy</i>, <i>boss-rule</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg084"></a>[Pg084]</span>
<i>per-diem</i>, <i>to lobby</i> and <i>boodler</i>; and the almost innumerable
verbs and verb-phrases: <i>to knife</i>, <i>to split a ticket</i>, <i>to go up
Salt River</i>, <i>to bolt</i>, <i>to eat crow</i>, <i>to boodle</i>, <i>to divvy</i>, <i>to grab</i> and
<i>to run</i>. An English candidate never <i>runs</i>; he <i>stands</i>. To <i>run</i>,
according to Thornton, was already used in America in 1789;
it was universal by 1820. <i>Platform</i> came in at the same time.
<i>Machine</i> was first applied to a political organization by Aaron
Burr. The use of <i>mugwump</i> is commonly thought to have originated
in the Blaine campaign of 1884, but it really goes back
to the 30's. <i>Anxious-bench</i> (or <i>anxious-seat</i>) at first designated
only the place occupied by the penitent at revivals, but was
used in its present political sense in Congress so early as 1842.
<i>Banner-state</i> appears in <cite>Niles' Register</cite> for December 5, 1840.
<i>Favorite-son</i> appears in an ode addressed to Washington on his
visit to Portsmouth, N. H., in 1789, but it did not acquire its
present ironical sense until it was applied to Martin Van Buren.
Thornton has traced <i>bolter</i> to 1812, <i>filibuster</i> to 1863, <i>roorback</i>
to 1844, and <i>split-ticket</i> to 1842. <i>Regularity</i> was an issue in
Tammany Hall in 1822.<a name="FNanchor_24_137" id="FNanchor_24_137"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24_137" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> There were <i>primaries</i> in New York
city in 1827, and hundreds of <i>repeaters</i> voted. In 1829 there
were <i>lobby-agents</i> at Albany, and they soon became <i>lobbyists</i>;
in 1832 <i>lobbying</i> had already extended to Washington. All of
these terms are now as firmly imbedded in the American vocabulary
as <i>election</i> or <i>congressman</i>.</p>

<p>In the department of conviviality the imaginativeness of
Americans has been shown in both the invention and the naming
of new and often highly complex beverages. So vast has been
the production of novelties, in fact, that England has borrowed
many of them, and their names with them. And not only England:
one buys <i>cocktails</i> and <i>gin-fizzes</i> in "American bars"
that stretch from Paris to Yokohama. <i>Cocktail</i>, <i>stone-fence</i> and
<i>sherry-cobbler</i> were mentioned by Irving in 1809;<a name="FNanchor_25_138" id="FNanchor_25_138"></a><a
href="#Footnote_25_138" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> by Thackeray's
day they were already well-known in England. Thornton
traces the <i>sling</i> to 1788, and the <i>stinkibus</i> and <i>anti-fogmatic</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg085"></a>[Pg085]</span>
both now extinct, to the same year. The origin of the <i>rickey</i>,
<i>fizz</i>, <i>sour</i>, <i>cooler</i>, <i>skin</i>, <i>shrub</i> and <i>smash</i>, and of such curious
American drinks as the <i>horse's neck</i>, <i>Mamie Taylor</i>, <i>Tom-and-Jerry</i>,
<i>Tom-Collins</i>, <i>John-Collins</i>, <i>bishop</i>, <i>stone-wall</i>, <i>gin-fix</i>,
<i>brandy-champarelle</i>, <i>golden-slipper</i>, <i>hari-kari</i>, <i>locomotive</i>, <i>whiskey-daisy</i>,
<i>blue-blazer</i>, <i>black-stripe</i>, <i>white-plush</i> and <i>brandy-crusta</i>
is quite unknown; the historians of alcoholism, like the
philologists, have neglected them.<a name="FNanchor_26_139" id="FNanchor_26_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_139" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But the essentially American
character of most of them is obvious, despite the fact that
a number have gone over into English. The English, in naming
their drinks, commonly display a far more limited imagination.
Seeking a name, for example, for a mixture of whiskey
and soda-water, the best they could achieve was <i>whiskey-and-soda</i>.
The Americans, introduced to the same drink, at once
gave it the far more original name of <i>high-ball</i>. So with <i>ginger-ale</i>
and <i>ginger-pop</i>. So with <i>minerals</i> and <i>soft-drinks</i>. Other
characteristic Americanisms (a few of them borrowed by the
English) are <i>red-eye</i>, <i>corn-juice</i>, <i>eye-opener</i>, <i>forty-rod</i>, <i>squirrel-whiskey</i>,
<i>phlegm-cutter</i>, <i>moon-shine</i>, <i>hard-cider</i>, <i>apple-jack</i> and
<i>corpse-reviver</i>, and the auxiliary drinking terms, <i>speak-easy</i>,
<i>sample-room</i>, <i>blind-pig</i>, <i>barrel-house</i>, <i>bouncer</i>, <i>bung-starter</i>, <i>dive</i>,
<i>doggery</i>, <i>schooner</i>, <i>shell</i>, <i>stick</i>, <i>duck</i>, <i>straight</i>, <i>saloon</i>, <i>finger</i>,
<i>pony</i> and <i>chaser</i>. Thornton shows that <i>jag</i>, <i>bust</i>, <i>bat</i> and <i>to
crook the elbow</i> are also Americanisms. So are <i>bartender</i> and
<i>saloon-keeper</i>. To them might be added a long list of common
American synonyms for <i>drunk</i>, for example, <i>piffled</i>, <i>pifflicated</i>,
<i>awry-eyed</i>, <i>tanked</i>, <i>snooted</i>, <i>stewed</i>, <i>ossified</i>, <i>slopped</i>, <i>fiddled</i>,
<i>edged</i>, <i>loaded</i>, <i>het-up</i>, <i>frazzled</i>, <i>jugged</i>, <i>soused</i>, <i>jiggered</i>, <i>corned</i>,

among English synonyms, but the former is obviously an Americanism
derived from <i>corn-whiskey</i> or <i>corn-juice</i>, and Thornton
says that the latter originated on this side of the Atlantic also. <span

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Loan-Words"></a>Loan-Words</h3>—The Indians of the new West, it would seem,
had little to add to the contributions already made to the American
vocabulary by the Algonquins of the Northeast. The
American people, by the beginning of the second quarter of the
nineteenth century, knew almost all they were destined to know
of the aborigine, and they had names for all the new objects
that he had brought to their notice and for most of his peculiar
implements and ceremonies. A few translated Indian terms,
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>squaw-man</i>, <i>big-chief</i>, <i>great-white-father</i> and <i>happy-hunting
ground</i>, represent the meagre fresh stock that the western pioneers
got from him. Of more importance was the suggestive
and indirect effect of his polysynthetic dialects, and particularly
of his vivid proper names, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Rain-in-the-Face</i>, <i>Young-Man-Afraid-of-His-Wife</i>
and <i>Voice-Like-Thunder</i>. These names, and
other word-phrases like them, made an instant appeal to American
humor, and were extensively imitated in popular slang.
One of the surviving coinages of that era is <i>Old-Stick-in-the-Mud</i>,
which Farmer and Henley note as having reached England by
1823.</div>

<p>Contact with the French in Louisiana and along the Canadian
border, and with the Spanish in Texas and further West, brought
many more new words. From the Canadian French, as we have
already seen, <i>prairie</i>, <i>batteau</i>, <i>portage</i> and <i>rapids</i> had been borrowed
during colonial days; to these French contributions
<i>bayou</i>, <i>picayune</i>, <i>levee</i>, <i>chute</i>, <i>butte</i>, <i>crevasse</i>, and <i>lagniappe</i>
were now added, and probably also <i>shanty</i> and <i>canuck</i>. The
use of <i>brave</i> to designate an Indian warrior, almost universal
until the close of the Indian wars, was also of French
origin.</p>

<p>From the Spanish, once the Mississippi was crossed, and particularly
after the Mexican war, in 1846, there came a swarm
of novelties, many of which have remained firmly imbedded in
the language. Among them were numerous names of strange
objects: <i>lariat</i>, <i>lasso</i>, <i>ranch</i>, <i>loco</i> (weed), <i>mustang</i>, <i>sombrero</i>,
<i>canyon</i>, <i>desperado</i>, <i>poncho</i>, <i>chapparel</i>, <i>corral</i>, <i>broncho</i>, <i>plaza</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg087"></a>[Pg087]</span>
<i>peon</i>, <i>cayuse</i>, <i>burro</i>, <i>mesa</i>, <i>tornado</i>, <i>sierra</i> and <i>adobe</i>. To them,
as soon as gold was discovered, were added <i>bonanza</i>, <i>eldorado</i>,
<i>placer</i> and <i>vigilante</i>. <i>Cinch</i> was borrowed from the Spanish
<i>cincha</i> in the early Texas days, though its figurative use did not
come in until much later. <i>Ante</i>, the poker term, though the
etymologists point out its obvious origin in the Latin, probably
came into American from the Spanish. Thornton's first example
of its use in its current sense is dated 1857, but Bartlett reported
it in the form of <i>anti</i> in 1848. <i>Coyote</i> came from the Mexican
dialect of Spanish; its first parent was the Aztec <i>coyotl</i>. <i>Tamale</i>
had a similar origin, and so did <i>frijole</i> and <i>tomato</i>. None
of these is good Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_27_140" id="FNanchor_27_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_140" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> As usual, derivatives quickly followed
the new-comers, among them <i>peonage</i>, <i>broncho-buster</i>,
<i>ranchman</i> and <i>ranch-house</i>, and the verbs <i>to ranch</i>, <i>to lasso</i>, <i>to
corral</i>, <i>to ante up</i>, and <i>to cinch</i>. <i>To vamose</i> (from the Spanish
<i>vamos</i>, let us go), came in at the same time. So did <i>sabe</i>. So
did <i>gazabo</i>.</p>

<p>This was also the period of the first great immigrations, and
the American people now came into contact, on a large scale,
with peoples of divergent race, particularly Germans, Irish
Catholics from the South of Ireland (the Irish of colonial days
"were descendants of Cromwell's army, and came from the
North of Ireland"),<a name="FNanchor_28_141" id="FNanchor_28_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_141" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and, on the Pacific Coast, Chinese. So
early as the 20's the immigration to the United States reached
25,000 in a year; in 1824 the Legislature of New York, in alarm,
passed a restrictive act.<a name="FNanchor_29_142" id="FNanchor_29_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_142" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The Know-Nothing movement of the
50's need not concern us here. Suffice it to recall that the immigration
of 1845 passed the 100,000 mark, and that that of
1854 came within sight of 500,000. These new Americans, most
of them Germans and Irish, did not all remain in the East; a
great many spread through the West and Southwest with the
other pioneers. Their effect upon the language was not large, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg088"></a>[Pg088]</span>
perhaps, but it was still very palpable, and not only in the vocabulary.
Of words of German origin, <i>saurkraut</i> and <i>noodle</i>, as we
have seen, had come in during the colonial period, apparently
through the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch, <i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, a mixture, much
debased, of the German dialects of Switzerland, Suabia and the
Palatinate. The new immigrants now contributed <i>pretzel</i>, <i>pumpernickel</i>,
<i>hausfrau</i>, <i>lager-beer</i>, <i>pinocle</i>, <i>wienerwurst</i>, <i>dumb</i> (for
stupid), <i>frankfurter</i>, <i>bock-beer</i>, <i>schnitzel</i>, <i>leberwurst</i>, <i>blutwurst</i>,
<i>rathskeller</i>, <i>schweizer</i> (cheese), <i>delicatessen</i>, <i>hamburger</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>,
steak), <i>kindergarten</i> and <i>katzenjammer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30_143" id="FNanchor_30_143"></a><a
href="#Footnote_30_143" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> From them, in all
probability, there also came two very familiar Americanisms,
<i>loafer</i> and <i>bum</i>. The former, according to the Standard Dictionary,
is derived from the German <i>laufen</i>; another authority
says that it originated in a German mispronounciation of <i>lover</i>,
<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, as <i>lofer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_31_144" id="FNanchor_31_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_144" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Thornton shows that the word was already in
common use in 1835. <i>Bum</i> was originally <i>bummer</i>, and apparently
derives from the German <i>bummler</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32_145" id="FNanchor_32_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_145" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Both words have produced
derivatives: <i>loaf</i> (noun), <i>to loaf</i>, <i>corner-loafer</i>, <i>common-loafer</i>,
<i>to bum</i>, <i>bum</i> (adj.) and <i>bummery</i>, not to mention <i>on the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg089"></a>[Pg089]</span>
bum</i>. <i>Loafer</i> has migrated in England, but <i>bum</i> is still unknown
there in the American sense. In English, indeed, <i>bum</i> is used to
designate an unmentionable part of the body and is thus not
employed in polite discourse.</p>

<p>Another example of debased German is offered by the American
<i>Kriss Kringle</i>. It is from <i>Christkindlein</i>, or <i>Christkind'l</i>,
and properly designates, of course, not the patron saint of Christmas,
but the child in the manger. A German friend tells me that
the form <i>Kriss Kringle</i>, which is that given in the Standard Dictionary,
and the form <i>Krisking'l</i>, which is that most commonly
used in the United States, are both quite unknown in Germany.
Here, obviously, we have an example of a loan-word in decay.
Whole phrases have gone through the same process, for example,
<i>nix come erous</i> (from <i>nichts kommt heraus</i>) and <i>'rous mit 'im</i>
(from <i>heraus mit ihm</i>). These phrases, like <i>wie geht's</i> and <i>ganz
gut</i>, are familiar to practically all Americans, no matter how
complete their ignorance of correct German. Most of them
know, too, the meaning of <i>gesundheit</i>, <i>kümmel</i>, <i>seidel</i>, <i>wanderlust</i>,
<i>stein</i>, <i>speck</i>, <i>maennerchor</i>, <i>schützenfest</i>, <i>sängerfest</i>, <i>turnverein</i>,
<i>hoch</i>, <i>yodel</i>, <i>zwieback</i>, and <i>zwei</i> (as in <i>zwei bier</i>). I have
found <i>snitz</i> (=<i>schnitz</i>) in <cite>Town Topics</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_33_146" id="FNanchor_33_146"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_146" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> <i>Prosit</i> is in all American
dictionaries.<a name="FNanchor_34_147" id="FNanchor_34_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_147" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> <i>Bower</i>, as used in cards, is an Americanism
derived from the German <i>bauer</i>, meaning the jack. The exclamation,
<i>ouch!</i> is classed as an Americanism by Thornton, and
he gives an example dated 1837. The New English Dictionary
refers it to the German <i>autsch</i>, and Thornton says that "it may
have come across with the Dunkers or the Mennonites." <i>Ouch</i>
is not heard in English, save in the sense of a clasp or buckle
set with precious stones (=OF <i>nouche</i>), and even in that sense it
is archaic. <i>Shyster</i> is very probably German also; Thornton has
traced it back to the 50's.<a name="FNanchor_35_148" id="FNanchor_35_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_148" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> <i>Rum-dumb</i> is grounded upon the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg090"></a>[Pg090]</span>
meaning of <i>dumb</i> borrowed from the German; it is not listed in
the English slang dictionaries.<a name="FNanchor_36_149" id="FNanchor_36_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_149" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Bristed says that the American
meaning of <i>wagon</i>, which indicates almost any four-wheeled,
horse-drawn vehicle in this country but only the very heaviest in
England, was probably influenced by the German <i>wagen</i>. He
also says that the American use of <i>hold on</i> for <i>stop</i> was suggested
by the German <i>halt an</i>, and White says that the substitution of
<i>standpoint</i> for <i>point of view</i>, long opposed by all purists, was
first made by an American professor who sought "an Anglicized
form" of the German <i>standpunkt</i>. The same German influence
may be behind the general facility with which American forms
compound nouns. In most other languages, for example, Latin
and French, the process is rare, and even English lags far behind
American. But in German it is almost unrestricted. "It is,"
says L. P. Smith, "a great step in advance toward that ideal
language in which meaning is expressed, not by terminations, but
by the simple method of word position."</p>

<p>The immigrants from the South of Ireland, during the period
under review, exerted an influence upon the language that was
vastly greater than that of the Germans, both directly and indirectly,
but their contributions to the actual vocabulary were probably
less. They gave American, indeed, relatively few new
words; perhaps <i>shillelah</i>, <i>colleen</i>, <i>spalpeen</i>, <i>smithereens</i> and <i>poteen</i>
exhaust the unmistakably Gaelic list. <i>Lallapalooza</i> is also
probably an Irish loan-word, though it is not Gaelic. It apparently
comes from <i>allay-foozee</i>, a Mayo provincialism, signifying
a sturdy fellow. <i>Allay-foozee</i>, in its turn, comes from the French
<i>Allez-fusil</i>, meaning "Forward the muskets!"—a memory, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg091"></a>[Pg091]</span>
according to P. W. Joyce,<a name="FNanchor_37_150" id="FNanchor_37_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_150" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> of the French landing at Killala in
1798. Such phrases as <i>Erin go bragh</i> and such expletives as
<i>begob</i> and <i>begorry</i> may perhaps be added: they have got into
American, though they are surely not distinctive Americanisms.
But of far more importance than these few contributions to the
vocabulary were certain speech habits that the Irish brought with
them—habits of pronunciation, of syntax and even of grammar.
These habits were, in part, the fruit of efforts to translate the
idioms of Gaelic into English, and in part borrowings from the
English of the age of James I. The latter, preserved by Irish
conservatism in speech,<a name="FNanchor_38_151" id="FNanchor_38_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_151" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> came into contact in America with
habits surviving, with more or less change, from the same time,
and so gave those American habits an unmistakable reinforcement.
The Yankees, so to speak, had lived down such Jacobean
pronunciations as <i>tay</i> for <i>tea</i> and <i>desave</i> for <i>deceive</i>, and these
forms, on Irish lips, struck them as uncouth and absurd, but they
still clung, in their common speech, to such forms as <i>h'ist</i> for
<i>hoist</i>, <i>bile</i> for <i>boil</i>, <i>chaw</i> for <i>chew</i>, <i>jine</i> for <i>join</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_152" id="FNanchor_39_152"></a><a
href="#Footnote_39_152" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> <i>sass</i> for <i>sauce</i>,
<i>heighth</i> for <i>height</i> and <i>rench</i> for <i>rinse</i> and <i>lep</i> for <i>leap</i>, and the
employment of precisely the same forms by the thousands of
Irish immigrants who spread through the country undoubtedly
gave them a certain support, and so protected them, in a measure,
from the assault of the purists. And the same support was
given to <i>drownded</i> for <i>drowned</i>, <i>oncet</i> for <i>once</i>, <i>ketch</i> for <i>catch</i>,
<i>ag'in</i> for <i>against</i> and <i>onery</i> for <i>ordinary</i>. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg092"></a>[Pg092]</span></p>

<p>Certain usages of Gaelic, carried over into the English of Ireland,
fell upon fertile soil in America. One was the employment
of the definite article before nouns, as in French and German.
An Irishman does not say "I am good at Latin," but "I am good
at <i>the</i> Latin." In the same way an American does not say "I
had measles," but "I had <i>the</i> measles." There is, again, the use
of the prefix <i>a</i> before various adjectives and gerunds, as in
<i>a-going</i> and <i>a-riding</i>. This usage, of course, is native to English,
as <i>aboard</i> and <i>afoot</i> demonstrate, but it is much more common in
the Irish dialect, on account of the influence of the parallel Gaelic
form, as in <i>a-n-aice</i>=<i>a-near</i>, and it is also much more common
in American. There is, yet again, a use of intensifying suffixes,
often set down as characteristically American, which was probably
borrowed from the Irish. Examples are <i>no-siree</i> and <i>yes-indeedy</i>,
and the later <i>kiddo</i> and <i>skiddoo</i>. As Joyce shows, such
suffixes, in Irish-English, tend to become whole phrases. The
Irishman is almost incapable of saying plain yes or no; he must
always add some extra and gratuitous asseveration.<a name="FNanchor_40_153" id="FNanchor_40_153"></a><a
href="#Footnote_40_153" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The American
is in like case. His speech bristles with intensives: <i>bet
your life</i>, <i>not on your life</i>, <i>well I guess</i>, <i>and no mistake</i>, and so on.
The Irish extravagance of speech struck a responsive chord in the
American heart. The American borrowed, not only occasional
words, but whole phrases, and some of them have become thoroughly
naturalized. Joyce, indeed, shows the Irish origin of
scores of locutions that are now often mistaken for native Americanisms,
for example, <i>great shakes</i>, <i>dead</i> (as an intensive), <i>thank
you kindly</i>, <i>to split one's sides</i> (<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, laughing), and <i>the tune the
old cow died of</i>, not to mention many familiar similes and proverbs.
Certain Irish pronunciations, Gaelic rather than archaic
English, got into American during the nineteenth century.
Among them, one recalls <i>bhoy</i>, which entered our political slang
in the middle 40's and survived into our own time. Again, there
is the very characteristic American word <i>ballyhoo</i>, signifying <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg093"></a>[Pg093]</span>
the harangue of a <i>ballyhoo-man</i>, or <i>spieler</i> (that is, barker) before
a cheap show, or, by metaphor, any noisy speech. It is from
<i>Ballyhooly</i>, the name of a village in Cork, once notorious for its
brawls. Finally, there is <i>shebang</i>. Schele de Vere derives it
from the French <i>cabane</i>, but it seems rather more likely that it
is from the Irish <i>shebeen</i>.</p>

<p>The propagation of Irishisms in the United States was helped,
during many years, by the enormous popularity of various
dramas of Irish peasant life, particularly those of Dion Boucicault.
So recently as 1910 an investigation made by the <cite>Dramatic
Mirror</cite> showed that some of his pieces, notably "Kathleen
Mavourneen," "The Colleen Bawn" and "The Shaugraun,"
were still among the favorites of popular audiences. Such plays,
at one time, were presented by dozens of companies, and a number
of Irish actors, among them Andrew Mack, Chauncey Olcott
and Boucicault himself, made fortunes appearing in them. An
influence also to be taken into account is that of Irish songs, once
in great vogue. But such influences, like the larger matter of
American borrowings from Anglo-Irish, remain to be investigated.
So far as I have been able to discover, there is not a
single article in print upon the subject. Here, as elsewhere, our
philologists have wholly neglected a very interesting field of
inquiry.</p>

<p>From other languages the borrowings during the period of
growth were naturally less. Down to the last decades of the nineteenth
century, the overwhelming majority of immigrants were
either Germans or Irish; the Jews, Italians and Slavs were yet to
come. But the first Chinese appeared in 1848, and soon their
speech began to contribute its inevitable loan-words. These
words, of course, were first adopted by the miners of the Pacific
Coast, and a great many of them have remained California localisms,
among them such verbs as <i>to yen</i> (to desire strongly, as a
Chinaman desires opium) and <i>to flop-flop</i> (to lie down), and such
nouns as <i>fun</i>, a measure of weight. But a number of others have
got into the common speech of the whole country, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>fan-tan</i>,
<i>kow-tow</i>, <i>chop-suey</i>, <i>ginseng</i>, <i>joss</i>, <i>yok-a-mi</i> and <i>tong</i>. Contrary
to the popular opinion, <i>dope</i> and <i>hop</i> are not from the Chinese. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg094"></a>[Pg094]</span>
Neither, in fact, is an Americanism, though the former has one
meaning that is specially American, <i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, that of information or
formula, as in <i>racing-dope</i> and <i>to dope out</i>. Most etymologists
derive the word from the Dutch <i>doop</i>, a sauce. In English, as in
American, it signifies a thick liquid, and hence the viscous cooked
opium. <i>Hop</i> is simply the common name of the <i>Humuluslupulus</i>.
The belief that hops have a soporific effect is very ancient, and
hop-pillows were brought to America by the first English colonists.</p>

<p>The derivation of <i>poker</i>, which came into American from California
in the days of the gold rush, has puzzled etymologists. It
is commonly derived from <i>primero</i>, the name of a somewhat similar
game, popular in England in the sixteenth century, but the
relation seems rather fanciful. It may possibly come, indirectly,
from the Danish word <i>pokker</i>, signifying the devil. <i>Pokerish</i>, in
the sense of alarming, was a common adjective in the United
States before the Civil War; Thornton gives an example dated
1827. Schele de Vere says that <i>poker</i>, in the sense of a hobgoblin,
was still in use in 1871, but he derives the name of the game
from the French <i>poche</i> (=<i>pouche</i>, <i>pocket</i>). He seems to believe
that the bank or pool, in the early days, was called the <i>poke</i>.
Barrère and Leland, rejecting all these guesses, derive <i>poker</i>
from the Yiddish <i>pochger</i>, which comes in turn from the verb
<i>pochgen</i>, signifying to conceal winnings or losses. This <i>pochgen</i>
is obviously related to the German <i>pocher</i> (=<i>boaster</i>, <i>braggart</i>).
There were a good many German Jews in California in the early
days, and they were ardent gamblers. If Barrère and Leland
are correct, then <i>poker</i> enjoys the honor of being the first loan-word
taken into American from the Yiddish.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 5</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Pronunciation"></a>Pronunciation</h3>—Noah Webster, as we saw in the last chapter,
sneered at the broad <i>a</i>, in 1789, as an Anglomaniac affectation.
In the course of the next 25 years, however, he seems to have suffered
a radical change of mind, for in "The American Spelling
Book," published in 1817, he ordained it in <i>ask</i>, <i>last</i>, <i>mass</i>, <i>aunt</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg095"></a>[Pg095]</span>
<i>grant</i>, <i>glass</i> and their analogues, and in his 1829 revision he clung
to this pronunciation, beside adding <i>master</i>, <i>pastor</i>, <i>amass</i>, <i>quaff</i>,
<i>laugh</i>, <i>craft</i>, etc., and even <i>massive</i>. There is some difficulty,
however, in determining just what sound he proposed to give the
<i>a</i>, for there are several <i>a</i>-sounds that pass as broad, and the two
main ones differ considerably. One appears in <i>all</i>, and may be
called the <i>aw</i>-sound. The other is in <i>art</i>, and may be called the
<i>ah</i>-sound. A quarter of a century later Richard Grant White
distinguished between the two, and denounced the former as "a
British peculiarity." Frank H. Vizetelly, writing in 1917, still
noted the difference, particularly in such words as <i>daunt</i>, <i>saunter</i>
and <i>laundry</i>. It is probable that Webster, in most cases,
intended to advocate the <i>ah</i>-sound, as in <i>father</i>, for this pronunciation
now prevails in New England. Even there, however, the
<i>a</i> often drops to a point midway between <i>ah</i> and <i>aa</i>, though never
actually descending to the flat <i>aa</i>, as in <i>an</i>, <i>at</i>
and <i>anatomy</i>.</div>

<p>But the imprimatur of the Yankee Johnson was not potent
enough to stay the course of nature, and, save in New England,
the flat <i>a</i> swept the country. He himself allowed it in <i>stamp</i> and
<i>vase</i>. His successor and rival, Lyman Cobb, decided for it in
<i>pass</i>, <i>draft</i>, <i>stamp</i> and <i>dance</i>, though he kept to the <i>ah</i>-sound in
<i>laugh</i>, <i>path</i>, <i>daunt</i> and <i>saunter</i>. By 1850 the flat <i>a</i> was dominant
everywhere West of the Berkshires and South of New
Haven, and had even got into such proper names as <i>Lafayette</i>
and <i>Nevada</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41_154" id="FNanchor_41_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_154" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Webster failed in a number of his other attempts to influence
American pronunciation. His advocacy of <i>deef</i> for <i>deaf</i> had
popular support while he lived, and he dredged up authority for
it out of Chaucer and Sir William Temple, but the present pronunciation
gradually prevailed, though <i>deef</i> remains familiar in
the common speech. Joseph E. Worcester and other rival lexicographers
stood against many of his pronunciations, and he took
the field against them in the prefaces to the successive editions of
his spelling-books. Thus, in that to "The Elementary Spelling <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg096"></a>[Pg096]</span>
Book," dated 1829, he denounced the "affectation" of inserting a
<i>y</i>-sound before the <i>u</i> in such words as <i>gradual</i> and <i>nature</i>, with
its compensatory change of <i>d</i> into a French <i>j</i> and of <i>t</i> into <i>ch</i>.
The English lexicographer, John Walker, had argued for this
"affectation" in 1791, but Webster's prestige, while he lived,
remained so high in some quarters that he carried the day, and
the older professors at Yale, it is said, continued to use <i>natur</i>
down to 1839.<a name="FNanchor_42_155" id="FNanchor_42_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_155" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> He favored the pronunciation of <i>either</i> and
<i>neither</i> as <i>ee-ther</i> and <i>nee-ther</i>, and so did most of the English
authorities of his time. The original pronunciation of the first
syllable, in England, probably made it rhyme with <i>bay</i>, but the
<i>ee</i>-sound was firmly established by the end of the eighteenth century.
Toward the middle of the following century, however,
there arose a fashion of an <i>ai</i>-sound, and this affectation was borrowed
by certain Americans. Gould, in the 50's, put the question,
"Why do you say <i>i</i>-ther and <i>ni</i>-ther?" to various Americans.
The reply he got was: "The words are so pronounced
by the best-educated people in England." This imitation still
prevails in the cities of the East. "All of us," says Lounsbury,
"are privileged in these latter days frequently to witness painful
struggles put forth to give to the first syllable of these words the
sound of <i>i</i> by those who have been brought up to give it the sound
of <i>e</i>. There is apparently an impression on the part of some that
such a pronunciation establishes on a firm foundation an otherwise
doubtful social standing."<a name="FNanchor_43_156" id="FNanchor_43_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_156" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But the vast majority of
Americans continue to say <i>ee-ther</i> and not <i>eye-ther</i>. White and
Vizetelly, like Lounsbury, argue that they are quite correct in so
doing. The use of <i>eye-ther</i>, says White, is no more than "a copy
of a second-rate British affectation."</p>

was unearthed to separate New England from the republic and make it
an English colony. The chief conspirator was one John Henry, who acted
under the instructions of Sir John Craig, Governor-General of Canada.</p></div>

first term, and Michigan during his second term. Kentucky was admitted
to the union in 1792, Tennessee in 1796, Ohio in 1803. Lewis and Clark
set out for the Pacific in 1804. The Louisiana Purchase was ratified in
1803, and Louisiana became a state in 1812.</p></div>

States, according to the last census, is now "in southern Indiana, in the
western part of Bloomington city, Monroe county." Can it be that this
early declaration of literary independence laid the foundation for Indiana's

(April 3, 1880). It was used in America 30 years before.</p></div>

class="label">[15]</span></a> This process, of course, is philologically respectable, however uncouth
its occasional products may be. By it we have acquired many everyday
words, among them, <i>to accept</i> (from <i>acceptum</i>), <i>to exact</i> (from <i>exactum</i>),
<i>to darkle</i> (from <i>darkling</i>), and <i>pea</i> (from <i>pease</i>=<i>pois</i>).</p></div>

and that it is derived from the name of Charles Lynch, a Virginia
justice of the peace, who jailed many Loyalists in 1780 without warrant in
law. The dissentient, Bristed, says that <i>to linch</i> is in various northern
English dialects, and means to beat or maltreat.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_130" id="Footnote_17_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_130"><span

America it is pronounced <i>holler</i> and usually represented in print by <i>hollo</i>
or <i>hollow</i>. I have often encountered <i>holloed</i> in the past tense. But the
Public Printer frankly accepts <i>holler</i>. <i class="abblatin">Vide</i> the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>,
May 12, 1917, p. 2309. The word, in the form of <i>hollering</i>, is here credited
to "Hon." John L. Burnett, of Alabama. There can be no doubt that the
hon. gentleman said <i>hollering</i>, and not <i>holloaing</i>, or <i>holloeing</i>, or <i>hollowing</i>,
or <i>hallooing</i>. <i>Hello</i> is apparently a variation of the same word.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_143" id="Footnote_30_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_143"><span
class="label">[30]</span></a> The majority of these words, it will be noted, relate to eating and
drinking. They mirror the profound effect of German immigration upon
American drinking habits and the American cuisine. It is a curious fact
that loan-words seldom represent the higher aspirations of the creditor
nation. French and German have borrowed from English, not words of
lofty significance, but such terms as <i>beefsteak</i>, <i>roast-beef</i>, <i>pudding</i>, <i>grog</i>,
<i>jockey</i>, <i>tourist</i>, <i>sport</i>, <i>five-o'clock-tea</i>, <i>cocktail</i> and <i>sweepstakes</i>. "The contributions
of England to European civilization, as tested by the English
words in Continental languages," says L. P. Smith, "are not, generally,
of a kind to cause much national self-congratulation." Nor would a
German, I daresay, be very proud of the German contributions to American.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_32_145" id="Footnote_32_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_145"><span
class="label">[32]</span></a> Thornton offers examples of this form ranging from 1856 to 1885.
During the Civil War the word acquired the special meaning of looter. The
Southerners thus applied it to Sherman's men. <i class="abblatin">Vide</i> Southern Historical
Society Papers, vol. xii, p. 428; Richmond, 1884. Here is a popular rhyme
that survived until the early 90's:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Vatch de shtore, psht, psht!<br />
Vhile I ketch de <i>bummer</i><br />
Vhat shtole de suit of clothes!</div>

<p><a name="Footnote_34_147" id="Footnote_34_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_147"><span
class="label">[34]</span></a> Nevertheless, when I once put it into a night-letter a Western Union
office refused to accept it, the rules requiring all night-letters to be in
"plain English." Meanwhile, the English have borrowed it from American,
and it is actually in the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35_148" id="Footnote_35_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_148"><span
class="label">[35]</span></a> The word is not in the Oxford Dictionary, but Cassell gives it and says
that it is German and an Americanism. The Standard Dictionary does
not give its etymology. Thornton's first example, dated 1856, shows a
variant spelling, <i>shuyster</i>, thus indicating that it was then recent. All
subsequent examples show the present spelling. It is to be noted that the
suffix <i>-ster</i> is not uncommon in English, and that it usually carries a
deprecatory significance, as in <i>trickster</i>, <i>punster</i>, <i>gamester</i>, etc.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_36_149" id="Footnote_36_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_149"><span

obviously from the German <i>dummkopf</i>, appears in a list of Kansas
words collected by Judge J. C. Ruppenthal, of Russell, Kansas. (<cite>Dialect
Notes</cite>, vol. iv, pt. v, 1916, p. 322.) It is also noted in Nebraska and the
Western Reserve, and is very common in Pennsylvania. <i>Uhrgucker</i>
(=<i>uhr-gucken</i>) is also on the Kansas list of Judge Ruppenthal.</p></div>

with <i>smile</i>. William Kenrick, in 1773, seems to have been the first English
lexicographer to denounce this pronunciation. <i>Tay</i> survived in England
until the second half of the eighteenth century. Then it fell into disrepute,
and certain purists, among them Lord Chesterfield, attempted to change the
<i>ea</i>-sound to <i>ee</i> in all words, including even <i>great</i>. <i class="abblatin">Cf.</i> the remarks under

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Differences_in_Usage"></a>Differences in Usage</h3>—The differences here listed, most of them
between words in everyday employment, are but examples of a
divergence in usage which extends to every department of daily
life. In his business, in his journeys from his home to his office,
in his dealings with his family and servants, in his sports and
amusements, in his politics and even in his religion the American
uses, not only words and phrases, but whole syntactical constructions,
that are unintelligible to the Englishman, or intelligible
only after laborious consideration. A familiar anecdote offers
an example in miniature. It concerns a young American woman
living in a region of prolific orchards who is asked by a visiting
Englishman what the residents do with so much fruit. Her
reply is a pun: "We eat all we can, and what we can't we can."
This answer would mystify nine Englishmen out of ten, for in
the first place it involves the use of the flat American <i>a</i> in <i>can't</i>
and in the second place it applies an unfamiliar name to the
vessel that every Englishman knows as a <i>tin</i>, and then adds to
the confusion by deriving a verb from the substantive. There
are no such things as <i>canned-goods</i> in England; over there they
are <i>tinned</i>. The <i>can</i> that holds them is a <i>tin</i>; <i>to can</i> them is <i>to
tin</i> them.... And they are counted, not as <i>groceries</i>, but as
<i>stores</i>, and advertised, not on <i>bill-boards</i> but on <i>hoardings</i>.<a
name="FNanchor_3_159" id="FNanchor_3_159"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_159" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And
the cook who prepares them for the table is not <i>Nora</i> or <i>Maggie</i>,
but <i>Cook</i>, and if she does other work in addition she is not a
<i>girl for general housework</i>, but a <i>cook-general</i>, and not <i>help</i>, but
a <i>servant</i>. And the boarder who eats them is not a <i>boarder</i> at all,
but a <i>paying-guest</i>, though he is said <i>to board</i>. And the grave of
the tin, once it is emptied, is not the <i>ash-can</i>, but the <i>dust-bin</i>,
and the man who carries it away is not the <i>garbage-man</i> or the
<i>ash-man</i> or the <i>white-wings</i>, but the <i>dustman</i>.</div>

<p>An Englishman, entering his home, does not walk in upon the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg103"></a>[Pg103]</span>
<i>first floor</i>, but upon the <i>ground floor</i>. What he calls the <i>first
floor</i> (or, more commonly, <i>first storey</i>, not forgetting the penultimate
<i>e</i>!) is what we call the <i>second floor</i>, and so on up to the
roof—which is covered not with <i>tin</i>, but with <i>slate</i>, <i>tiles</i> or <i>leads</i>.
He does not <i>take</i> a paper; he <i>takes in</i> a paper. He does not ask
his servant, "is there any <i>mail</i> for me?" but, "are there any <i>letters</i>
for me?" for <i>mail</i>, in the American sense, is a word that he
seldom uses, save in such compounds as <i>mail-van</i> and <i>mail-train</i>.
He always speaks of it as <i>the post</i>. The man who brings it is
not a <i>letter-carrier</i>, but a <i>postman</i>. It is <i>posted</i>, not <i>mailed</i>, at
a <i>pillar-box</i>, not at a <i>mail-box</i>. It never includes <i>postal-cards</i>,
but only <i>post-cards</i>; never <i>money-orders</i>, but only <i>postal-orders</i>.
The Englishman dictates his answers, not to a <i>typewriter</i>, but to
a <i>typist</i>; a <i>typewriter</i> is merely the machine. If he desires the
recipient to call him by telephone he doesn't say, "<i>phone me</i> at a
quarter <i>of</i> eight," but "<i>ring me up</i> at a quarter <i>to</i> eight." And
when the call comes he says "<i>are you there?</i>" When he gets
home, he doesn't find his wife waiting for him in the <i>parlor</i> or
<i>living-room</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_160" id="FNanchor_4_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_160"
 class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
but in the <i>drawing-room</i> or in her <i>sitting-room</i>, and
the tale of domestic disaster that she has to tell does not concern
the <i>hired-girl</i> but the <i>slavey</i> and the <i>scullery-maid</i>. He doesn't
bring her a box of <i>candy</i>, but a box of <i>sweets</i>. He doesn't leave
a <i>derby</i> hat in the hall, but a <i>bowler</i>. His wife doesn't wear
<i>shirtwaists</i> but <i>blouses</i>. When she buys one she doesn't say
"<i>charge it</i>" but "<i>put it down</i>." When she orders a <i>tailor-made
suit</i>, she calls it a <i>coat-and-skirt</i>. When she wants a <i>spool of
thread</i> she asks for a <i>reel of cotton</i>. Such things are bought, not
in the <i>department-stores</i>, but at the <i>stores</i>, which are substantially
the same thing. In these stores <i>calico</i> means a plain cotton
cloth; in the United States it means a printed cotton cloth.
Things bought on the instalment plan in England are said to be
bought on the <i>hire-purchase</i> plan or system; the instalment business
itself is the <i>credit-trade</i>. Goods ordered by <i>post</i> (not mail)
on which the dealer pays the cost of transportation are said to be
sent, not <i>postpaid</i> or <i>prepaid</i>, but <i>post-free</i> or <i>carriage-paid</i>. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg104"></a>[Pg104]</span></p>

<p>An Englishman does not wear <i>suspenders</i> and <i>neckties</i>, but
<i>braces</i> and <i>cravats</i>. <i>Suspenders</i> are his wife's garters; his own
are <i>sock-suspenders</i>. The family does not seek sustenance in a
<i>rare tenderloin</i> and <i>squash</i>, but in <i>underdone under-cut</i> and <i>vegetable
marrow</i>. It does not eat <i>beets</i>, but <i>beet-roots</i>. The wine
on the table, if miraculously German, is not <i>Rhine wine</i>, but
<i>Hock</i>.... The maid who laces the stays of the mistress of the
house is not <i>Maggie</i> but <i>Robinson</i>. The nurse-maid is not <i>Lizzie</i>
but <i>Nurse</i>. So, by the way, is a trained nurse in a hospital, whose
full style is not <i>Miss Jones</i>, but <i>Nurse Jones</i>. And the hospital
itself, if private, is not a hospital at all, but a <i>nursing-home</i>, and
its trained nurses are plain <i>nurses</i>, or <i>hospital nurses</i>, or maybe
<i>nursing sisters</i>. And the white-clad young gentlemen who make
love to them are not <i>studying medicine</i> but <i>walking the hospitals</i>.
Similarly, an English law student does not study law, but <i>the</i>
law.</p>

<p>If an English boy goes to a <i>public school</i>, it is not a sign that
he is getting his education free, but that his father is paying a
good round sum for it and is accepted as a gentleman. A <i>public
school</i> over there corresponds to our <i>prep school</i>; it is a place
maintained chiefly by endowments, wherein boys of the upper
classes are prepared for the universities. What we know as a
<i>public school</i> is called a <i>board school</i> in England, not because the
pupils are boarded but because it is managed by a school board.
English school-boys are divided, not into <i>classes</i>, or <i>grades</i>, but
into <i>forms</i>, which are numbered, the lowest being the <i>first form</i>.
The benches they sit on are also called <i>forms</i>. The principal of
an English school is a <i>head-master</i> or <i>head-mistress</i>; the lower
pedagogues used to be <i>ushers</i>, but are now <i>assistant masters</i> (or
<i>mistresses</i>). The head of a university is a <i>chancellor</i>. He is
always some eminent public man, and a <i>vice-chancellor</i> performs
his duties. The head of a mere college may be a <i>president</i>, <i>principal</i>,
<i>rector</i>, <i>dean</i> or <i>provost</i>. At the universities the students
are not divided into <i>freshmen</i>, <i>sophomores</i>, <i>juniors</i> and <i>seniors</i>,
as with us, but are simply <i>first-year men</i>, <i>second-year men</i>, and so
on. Such distinctions, however, are not as important in England
as in America; members of the university (they are called <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg105"></a>[Pg105]</span>
<i>members</i>, not <i>students</i>) do not flock together according to seniority.
An English university man does not <i>study</i>; he <i>reads</i>. He knows
nothing of <i>frats</i>, <i>class-days</i>, <i>senior-proms</i> and such things; save
at Cambridge and Dublin he does not even have a <i>commencement</i>.
On the other hand his daily speech is full of terms unintelligible
to an American student, for example, <i>wrangler</i>, <i>tripos</i>, <i>head</i>, <i>pass-degree</i>
and <i>don</i>.</p>

<p>The upkeep of board-schools in England comes out of the <i>rates</i>,
which are local taxes levied upon householders. For that reason
an English municipal taxpayer is called a <i>ratepayer</i>. The functionaries
who collect and spend his money are not <i>office-holders</i>
but <i>public-servants</i>. The head of the local police is not a <i>chief of
police</i>, but a <i>chief constable</i>. The fire <i>department</i> is the fire
<i>brigade</i>. The <i>street-cleaner</i> is a <i>crossing-sweeper</i>. The parish
<i>poorhouse</i> is a <i>workhouse</i>. If it is maintained by two or more
parishes jointly it becomes a <i>union</i>. A pauper who accepts its
hospitality is said to be <i>on the rates</i>. A policeman is a <i>bobby</i>
familiarly and <i>constable</i> officially. He is commonly mentioned in
the newspapers, not by his surname, but as <i>P. C. 643a</i>—<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>,
Police Constable No. 643a. The <i>fire laddie</i>, the <i>ward executive</i>,
the <i>roundsman</i>, the <i>strong-arm squad</i> and other such objects of
American devotion are unknown in England. An English saloon-keeper
is officially a licensed <i>victualler</i>. His saloon is a
<i>public house</i>, or, colloquially, a <i>pub</i>. He does not sell beer by
the <i>bucket</i> or <i>can</i> or <i>growler</i> or <i>schooner</i>, but by the <i>pint</i>. He
and his brethren, taken together, are the <i>licensed trade</i>. His
back-room is a <i>parlor</i>. If he has a few upholstered benches in
his place he usually calls it a <i>lounge</i>. He employs no <i>bartenders</i>
or <i>mixologists</i>. <i>Barmaids</i> do the work, with maybe a <i>barman</i> to
help.</p>

<p>The American language, as we have seen, has begun to take
in the English <i>boot</i> and <i>shop</i>, and it is showing hospitality to
<i>head-master</i>, <i>haberdasher</i> and <i>week-end</i>, but <i>subaltern</i>, <i>civil servant</i>,
<i>porridge</i>, <i>moor</i>, <i>draper</i>, <i>treacle</i>, <i>tram</i> and <i>mufti</i> are still
strangers in the United States, as <i>bleachers</i>, <i>picayune</i>, <i>air-line</i>,
<i>campus</i>, <i>chore</i>, <i>scoot</i>, <i>stogie</i> and <i>hoodoo</i> are in England. A <i>subaltern</i>
is a commissioned officer in the army, under the rank of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg106"></a>[Pg106]</span>
captain. A <i>civil servant</i> is a public servant in the national civil
service; if he is of high rank, he is usually called a <i>permanent
official</i>. <i>Porridge</i>, <i>moor</i>, <i>scullery</i>, <i>draper</i>, <i>treacle</i> and <i>tram</i>,
though unfamiliar, still need no explanation. <i>Mufti</i> means ordinary
male clothing; an army officer out of uniform is said to be in
<i>mufti</i>. To this officer a sack-suit or business-suit is a <i>lounge-suit</i>.
He carries his clothes, not in a <i>trunk</i> or <i>grip</i> or <i>suit-case</i>,
but in a <i>box</i>. He does not <i>miss</i> a train; he <i>loses</i> it. He does not
ask for a <i>round-trip</i> ticket, but for a <i>return</i> ticket. If he proposes
to go to the theatre he does not <i>reserve</i> or <i>engage</i> seats; he
<i>books</i> them, and not at the <i>box-office</i>, but at the <i>booking-office</i>.
If he sits downstairs, it is not in the <i>orchestra</i>, but in the <i>stalls</i>.
If he likes vaudeville, he goes to a <i>music-hall</i>, where the <i>head-liners</i>
are <i>top-liners</i>. If he has to stand in line, he does it, not in
a <i>line</i>, but in a <i>queue</i>.</p>

<p>In England a corporation is a <i>public company</i> or <i>limited liability
company</i>. The term <i>corporation</i>, over there, is applied to
the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs of a city, as in <i>the London
corporation</i>. An Englishman writes <i>Ltd.</i> after the name of an
incorporated bank or trading company as we write <i>Inc.</i> He calls
its president its <i>chairman</i> or <i>managing director</i>. Its stockholders
are its <i>shareholders</i>, and hold <i>shares</i> instead of <i>stock</i> in it.
Its bonds are <i>debentures</i>. The place wherein such companies are
floated and looted—the Wall Street of England—is called the
<i>City</i>, with a capital <i>C</i>. Bankers, stock-jobbers, promoters, directors
and other such leaders of its business are called <i>City</i>
men. The financial editor of a newspaper is its <i>City</i> editor.
Government bonds are <i>consols</i>, or <i>stocks</i>, or the <i>funds</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_161" id="FNanchor_5_161"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5_161" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> To have
<i>money in the stocks</i> is to own such bonds. Promissory notes are
<i>bills</i>. An Englishman hasn't a <i>bank-account</i>, but a <i>banking-account</i>.
He draws <i>cheques</i> (not <i>checks</i>), not on his <i>bank</i>, but
on his <i>bankers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_162" id="FNanchor_6_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_162" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In England there is a rigid distinction between
a <i>broker</i> and a <i>stock-broker</i>. A <i>broker</i> means, not a dealer in <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg107"></a>[Pg107]</span>
securities, as in our <i>Wall Street broker</i>, but a dealer in second-hand
furniture. <i>To have the brokers</i><a name="FNanchor_7_163" id="FNanchor_7_163"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_163" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <i>in the house</i> means to be
bankrupt, with one's very household goods in the hands of one's
creditors.</p>

<p><i>Tariff reform</i>, in England, does not mean a movement toward
free trade, but one toward protection. The word <i>Government</i>,
meaning what we call the administration, is always capitalized
and plural, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, "The Government <i>are</i> considering the advisability,
etc." <i>Vestry</i>, <i>committee</i>, <i>council</i>, <i>ministry</i> and even
<i>company</i> are also plural, though sometimes not capitalized. A
member of Parliament does not <i>run</i> for office; he <i>stands</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_164" id="FNanchor_8_164"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_164" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He
does not make a <i>campaign</i>, but a <i>canvass</i>. He does not represent
a <i>district</i>, but a <i>division</i> or <i>constituency</i>. He never makes
a <i>stumping trip</i>, but always a <i>speaking tour</i>. When he looks
after his fences he calls it <i>nursing the constituency</i>. At a political
meeting (they are often rough in England) the <i>bouncers</i> are
called <i>stewards</i>; the suffragettes used to delight in stabbing them
with hatpins. A member of Parliament is not afflicted by the
numerous bugaboos that menace an American congressman. He
knows nothing of <i>lame ducks</i>, <i>pork barrels</i>, <i>gag-rule</i>, <i>junkets</i>,
<i>gerrymanders</i>, <i>omnibus bills</i>, <i>snakes</i>, <i>niggers in the woodpile</i>,
<i>Salt river</i>, <i>crow</i>, <i>bosses</i>, <i>ward heelers</i>, <i>men higher up</i>, <i>silk-stockings</i>,
<i>repeaters</i>, <i>ballot-box stuffers</i> and <i>straight</i> and <i>split tickets</i>
(he always calls them <i>ballots</i> or <i>voting papers</i>). He has never
heard of <i>direct primaries</i>, the <i>recall</i> or the <i>initiative and referendum</i>.
A <i>roll-call</i> in Parliament is a <i>division</i>. A member
speaking is said to be <i>up</i> or <i>on his legs</i>. When the house adjourns
it is said to <i>rise</i>. A member referring to another in the
course of a debate does not say "the gentleman from Manchester,"
but "the <i>honorable</i> gentleman" (written <i>hon. gentleman</i>)
or, if he happens to be a privy councillor, "the <i>right honorable</i>
gentleman," or, if he is a member for one of the universities,
"the <i>honorable and learned</i> gentleman." If the speaker chooses
to be intimate or facetious, he may say "my honorable <i>friend</i>." <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg108"></a>[Pg108]</span></p>

<p>In the United States a <i>pressman</i> is a man who runs a printing
press; in England he is a newspaper reporter, or, as the English
usually say, a <i>journalist</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_165" id="FNanchor_9_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_165" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This journalist works, not at <i>space</i>
rates, but at <i>lineage</i> rates. A printing press is a <i>machine</i>. An
editorial in a newspaper is a <i>leading article</i> or <i>leader</i>. An
editorial paragraph is a <i>leaderette</i>. A newspaper clipping is a
<i>cutting</i>. A proof-reader is a <i>corrector of the press</i>. A pass to
the theatre is an <i>order</i>. The room-clerk of a hotel is the <i>secretary</i>.
A real-estate agent or dealer is an <i>estate-agent</i>. The English
keep up most of the old distinctions between physicians and
surgeons, barristers and solicitors. A surgeon is often plain
<i>Mr.</i>, and not <i>Dr.</i> Neither he nor a doctor has an <i>office</i>, but always
a <i>surgery</i> or <i>consulting room</i>. A barrister is greatly superior
to a solicitor. He alone can address the higher courts and
the parliamentary committees; a solicitor must keep to office
work and the courts of first instance. A man with a grievance
goes first to his solicitor, who then <i>instructs</i> or <i>briefs</i> a barrister
for him. If that barrister, in the course of the trial, wants certain
evidence removed from the record, he moves that it be <i>struck
out</i>, not <i>stricken out</i>, as an American lawyer would say. Only
barristers may become judges. An English barrister, like his
American brother, takes a <i>retainer</i> when he is engaged. But the
rest of his fee does not wait upon the termination of the case: he
expects and receives a <i>refresher</i> from time to time. A barrister
is never admitted to the bar, but is always <i>called</i>. If he becomes
a <i>King's Counsel</i>, or <i>K. C.</i> (a purely honorary appointment), he
is said to have <i>taken silk</i>.</p>

<p>The common objects and phenomena of nature are often differently
named in English and American. As we saw in a previous
chapter, such Americanisms as <i>creek</i> and <i>run</i>, for small streams,
are practically unknown in England, and the English <i>moor</i> and
<i>downs</i> early disappeared from American. The Englishman
knows the meaning of <i>sound</i> (<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, Long Island <i>Sound</i>), but he <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg109"></a>[Pg109]</span>
nearly always uses <i>channel</i> in place of it. In the same way the
American knows the meaning of the English <i>bog</i>, but rejects the
English distinction between it and <i>swamp</i>, and almost always
uses <i>swamp</i>, or <i>marsh</i> (often elided to <i>ma'sh</i>). The Englishman
seldom, if ever, describes a severe storm as a <i>hurricane</i>, a <i>cyclone</i>,
a <i>tornado</i> or a <i>blizzard</i>. He never uses <i>cold-snap</i>, <i>cloudburst</i> or
<i>under the weather</i>. He does not say that the temperature is <i>29
degrees</i> (Fahrenheit) or that the thermometer or the mercury is
at 29 degrees, but that there are <i>three degrees of frost</i>. He calls
ice water <i>iced-water</i>. He knows nothing of <i>blue-grass</i> country
or of <i>pennyr'yal</i>. What we call the <i>mining regions</i> he knows as
the <i>black country</i>. He never, of course, uses <i>down-East</i> or <i>up-State</i>.
Many of our names for common fauna and flora are unknown
to him save as strange Americanisms, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>terrapin</i>, <i>moose</i>,
<i>persimmon</i>, <i>gumbo</i>, <i>egg-plant</i>, <i>alfalfa</i>, <i>sweet-corn</i>, <i>sweet-potato</i>
and <i>yam</i>. Until lately he called the <i>grapefruit</i> a <i>shaddock</i>. He
still calls the <i>beet</i> a <i>beet-root</i> and the <i>rutabaga</i> a <i>mangel-wurzel</i>.
He is familiar with many fish that we seldom see, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, the <i>turbot</i>.
He also knows the <i>hare</i>, which is seldom heard of in America.
But he knows nothing of <i>devilled-crabs</i>, <i>crab-cocktails</i>, <i>clam-chowder</i>
or <i>oyster-stews</i>, and he never goes to <i>oyster-suppers</i>,
<i>clam-bakes</i> or <i>burgoo-picnics</i>. He doesn't buy <i>peanuts</i> when he
goes to the circus. He calls them <i>monkey-nuts</i>, and to eat them
publicly is <i class="abblatin">infra dig</i>. The common American use of <i>peanut</i> as
an adjective of disparagement, as in <i>peanut politics</i>, is incomprehensible
to him.</p>

<p>In England a <i>hack</i> is not a public coach, but a horse let out at
hire, or one of similar quality. A life insurance policy is usually
not an insurance policy at all, but an <i>assurance</i> policy. What
we call the normal income tax is the <i>ordinary</i> tax; what we call
the surtax is the <i>supertax</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_166" id="FNanchor_10_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_166" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> An Englishman never lives <i>on</i> a
street, but always <i>in</i> it. He never lives in a <i>block</i> of houses, but
in a <i>row</i>; it is never in a <i>section</i> of the city, but always in a
<i>district</i>. Going home by train he always takes the <i>down-train</i>,
no matter whether he be proceeding southward to Wimbleton, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg110"></a>[Pg110]</span>
westward to Shepherd's Bush, northward to Tottenham or eastward
to Noak's Hill. A train headed toward London is always
an <i>up-train</i>, and the track it runs on is the <i>up-line</i>. <i>Eastbound</i>
and <i>westbound</i> tracks and trains are unknown in England.
When an Englishman boards a bus it is not at a <i>street-corner</i>,
but at a <i>crossing</i>, though he is familiar with such forms as Hyde
Park <i>Corner</i>. The place he is bound for is not three <i>squares</i> or
<i>blocks</i> away, but three <i>turnings</i>. <i>Square</i>, in England, always
means a small park. A backyard is a <i>garden</i>. A subway is
always a <i>tube</i>, or the <i>underground</i>, or the <i>Metro</i>. But an underground
passage for pedestrians is a <i>subway</i>. English streets
have no <i>sidewalks</i>; they always call them <i>pavements</i> or <i>footways</i>.
An automobile is always a <i>motor-car</i> or <i>motor</i>. <i>Auto</i> is almost
unknown, and with it the verb <i>to auto</i>. So is <i>machine</i>. So is
<i>joy-ride</i>.</p>

<p>An Englishman always calls russet, yellow or tan shoes <i>brown</i>
shoes (or, if they cover the ankle, <i>boots</i>). He calls a pocketbook
a <i>purse</i>, and gives the name of <i>pocketbook</i> to what we call a
<i>memorandum-book</i>. His walking-stick is always a <i>stick</i>, never a
<i>cane</i>. By <i>cord</i> he means something strong, almost what we call
<i>twine</i>; a thin cord he always calls a <i>string</i>; his <i>twine</i> is the lightest
sort of <i>string</i>. When he applies the adjective <i>homely</i> to a
woman he means that she is simple and home-loving, not necessarily
that she is plain. He uses <i>dessert</i>, not to indicate the
whole last course at dinner, but to designate the fruit only; the
rest is <i>ices</i> or <i>sweets</i>. He uses <i>vest</i>, not in place of <i>waistcoat</i>, but
in place of <i>undershirt</i>. Similarly, he applies <i>pants</i>, not to his
trousers, but to his drawers. An Englishman who inhabits bachelor
quarters is said to live in <i>chambers</i>; if he has a flat he calls
it a <i>flat</i>, and not an <i>apartment</i>;<a name="FNanchor_11_167" id="FNanchor_11_167"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11_167" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> <i>flat-houses</i> are often <i>mansions</i>.
The janitor or superintendent thereof is a <i>care-taker</i>. The
scoundrels who snoop around in search of divorce evidence are
not <i>private detectives</i>, but <i>private enquiry agents</i>. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg111"></a>[Pg111]</span></p>

<p>The Englishman is naturally unfamiliar with baseball, and in
consequence his language is bare of the countless phrases and
metaphors that it has supplied to American. Many of these
phrases and metaphors are in daily use among us, for example,
<i>fan</i>, <i>rooter</i>, <i>bleachers</i>, <i>batting-average</i>, <i>double-header</i>, <i>pennant-winner</i>,
<i>gate-money</i>, <i>busher</i>, <i>minor-leaguer</i>, <i>glass-arm</i>, <i>to strike
out</i>, <i>to foul</i>, <i>to be shut out</i>, <i>to coach</i>, <i>to play ball</i>, <i>on the bench</i>,
<i>on to his curves</i> and <i>three strikes and out</i>. The national game of
draw-poker has also greatly enriched American with terms that
are either quite unknown to the Englishman, or known to him
only as somewhat dubious Americanisms, among them <i>cold-deck</i>,
<i>kitty</i>, <i>full-house</i>, <i>divvy</i>, <i>a card up his sleeve</i>, <i>three-of-a-kind</i>, <i>to
ante up</i>, <i>to pony up</i>, <i>to hold out</i>, <i>to cash in</i>, <i>to go it one better</i>,
<i>to chip in</i> and <i>for keeps</i>. But the Englishman uses many more
racing terms and metaphors than we do, and he has got a good
many phrases from other games, particularly cricket. The word
<i>cricket</i> itself has a definite figurative meaning. It indicates, in
general, good sportsmanship. To take unfair advantage of an
opponent is not <i>cricket</i>. The sport of boating, so popular on the
Thames, has also given colloquial English some familiar terms,
almost unknown in the United States, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>punt</i> and <i>weir</i>. Contrariwise,
<i>pungy</i>, <i>batteau</i> and <i>scow</i> are unheard of in England,
and <i>canoe</i> is not long emerged from the estate of an Americanism.<a name="FNanchor_12_168" id="FNanchor_12_168"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_168" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The game known as <i>ten-pins</i> in America is called <i>nine-pins</i>
in England, and once had that name over here. The Puritans
forbade it, and its devotees changed its name in order to
evade the prohibition.<a name="FNanchor_13_169" id="FNanchor_13_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_169" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Finally, there is <i>soccer</i>, a form of football
quite unknown in the United States. What we call simply
football is <i>Rugby</i> or <i>Rugger</i> to the Englishman. The word
<i>soccer</i> is derived from <i>association</i>; the rules of the game were <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg112"></a>[Pg112]</span>
established by the London Football Association. <i>Soccer</i> is one of
the relatively few English experiments in ellipsis. Another is to
be found in <i>Bakerloo</i>, the name of one of the London underground
lines, from <i>Baker-street</i> and <i>Waterloo</i>, its termini.</p>

<p>The English have an ecclesiastical vocabulary with which we
are almost unacquainted, and it is in daily use, for the church
bulks large in public affairs over there. Such terms as <i>vicar</i>,
<i>canon</i>, <i>verger</i>, <i>prebendary</i>, <i>primate</i>, <i>curate</i>, <i>non-conformist</i>, <i>dissenter</i>,
<i>convocation</i>, <i>minster</i>, <i>chapter</i>, <i>crypt</i>, <i>living</i>, <i>presentation</i>,
<i>glebe</i>, <i>benefice</i>, <i>locum tenens</i>, <i>suffragan</i>, <i>almoner</i>, <i>dean</i> and <i>pluralist</i>
are to be met with in the English newspapers constantly,
but on this side of the water they are seldom encountered. Nor
do we hear much of <i>matins</i>, <i>lauds</i>, <i>lay-readers</i>, <i>ritualism</i> and the
<i>liturgy</i>. The English use of <i>holy orders</i> is also strange to us.
They do not say that a young man is <i>studying for the ministry</i>,
but that he is <i>reading for holy orders</i>. They do not say that he
is <i>ordained</i>, but that he <i>takes orders</i>. Save he be in the United
Free Church of Scotland, he is never a <i>minister</i>; save he be a
nonconformist, he is never a <i>pastor</i>; a clergyman of the Establishment
is always either a <i>rector</i>, a <i>vicar</i> or a <i>curate</i>, and colloquially
a <i>parson</i>.</p>

<p>In American <i>chapel</i> simply means a small church, usually the
branch of some larger one; in English it has the special sense of
a place of worship unconnected with the establishment. Though
three-fourths of the people of Ireland are Catholics (in Munster
and Connaught, more than nine-tenths), and the Protestant
Church of Ireland has been disestablished since 1871, a Catholic
place of worship in the country is still a <i>chapel</i> and not a
<i>church</i>.<a name="FNanchor_14_170" id="FNanchor_14_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_170" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> So is a Methodist wailing-place in England, however
large it may be, though now and then <i>tabernacle</i> is substituted.
In the same way the English Catholics sometimes vary <i>chapel</i>
with <i>oratory</i>, as in <i>Brompton Oratory</i>. A Methodist, in Great <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg113"></a>[Pg113]</span>
Britain, is not a <i>Methodist</i>, but a <i>Wesleyan</i>. Contrariwise, what
the English call simply a <i>churchman</i> is an <i>Episcopalian</i> in the
United States, what they call the <i>Church</i> (always capitalized!) is
the <i>Protestant Episcopal</i> Church,<a name="FNanchor_15_171" id="FNanchor_15_171"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15_171" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> what they call a <i>Roman
Catholic</i> is simply a <i>Catholic</i>, and what they call a <i>Jew</i> is usually
softened (if he happens to be an advertiser) to a <i>Hebrew</i>. The
English Jews have no such idiotic fear of the plain name as that
which afflicts the more pushing and obnoxious of the race in
America.<a name="FNanchor_16_172" id="FNanchor_16_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_172" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
"News of <i>Jewry</i>" is a common head-line in the <cite>London
Daily Telegraph</cite>, which is owned by Lord Burnham, a Jew,
and has had many Jews on its staff, including Judah P. Benjamin,
the American. The American language, of course, knows
nothing of <i>dissenters</i>. Nor of such gladiators of dissent as the
<i>Plymouth Brethren</i>, nor of the <i>nonconformist conscience</i>, though
the United States suffers from it even more damnably than England.
The English, to make it even, get on without <i>circuit-riders</i>,
<i>holy-rollers</i>, <i>Dunkards</i>, <i>Seventh Day Adventists</i> and other
such American <i>ferae naturae</i>, and are born, live, die and go to
heaven without the aid of either the <i>uplift</i> or the <i>chautauqua</i>.</p>

<p>In music the English cling to an archaic and unintelligible
nomenclature, long since abandoned in America. Thus they call
a double whole note a <i>breve</i>, a whole note a <i>semibreve</i>, a half note
a <i>minim</i>, a quarter note a <i>crotchet</i>, an eighth note a <i>quaver</i>, a
sixteenth note a <i>semi-quaver</i>, a thirty-second note a <i>demisemiquaver</i>,
and a sixty-fourth note a <i>hemidemisemiquaver</i>, or <i>semidemisemiquaver</i>.
If, by any chance, an English musician should
write a one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth note he probably wouldn't
know what to call it. This clumsy terminology goes back to the
days of plain chant, with its <i>longa</i>, <i>brevis</i>, <i>semi-brevis</i>, <i>minima</i>
and <i>semiminima</i>. The French and Italians cling to a system almost
as confusing, but the Germans use <i>ganze</i>, <i>halbe</i>, <i>viertel</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg114"></a>[Pg114]</span>
<i>achtel</i>, etc. I have been unable to discover the beginnings of
the American system, but it would seem to be borrowed from
the German. Since the earliest times the majority of music
teachers in the United States have been Germans, and most of
the rest have had German training.</p>

<p>In the same way the English hold fast to a clumsy and inaccurate
method of designating the sizes of printers' types. In
America the simple point system makes the business easy; a line
of <i>14-point</i> type occupies exactly the vertical space of two lines
of <i>7-point</i>. But the English still indicate differences in size by
such arbitrary and confusing names as <i>brilliant</i>, <i>diamond</i>, <i>small
pearl</i>, <i>pearl</i>, <i>ruby</i>, <i>ruby-nonpareil</i>, <i>nonpareil</i>, <i>minion-nonpareil</i>,
<i>emerald</i>, <i>minion</i>, <i>brevier</i>, <i>bourgeois</i>, <i>long primer</i>, <i>small pica</i>, <i>pica</i>,
<i>English</i>, <i>great primer</i> and <i>double pica</i>. They also cling to a
fossil system of numerals in stating ages. Thus, an Englishman
will say that he is <i>seven-and-forty</i>, not that he is <i>forty-seven</i>.
This is probably a direct survival, preserved by more than a
thousand years of English conservatism, of the Anglo-Saxon
<i>seofan-and-feowertig</i>. He will also say that he weighs eleven
<i>stone</i> instead of 154 pounds. A <i>stone</i> is 14 pounds, and it is
always used in stating the heft of a man. Finally, he employs
such designations of time as <i>fortnight</i> and <i>twelvemonth</i> a great
deal more than we do, and has certain special terms of which we
know nothing, for example, <i>quarter-day</i>, <i>bank holiday</i>, <i>long vacation</i>,
<i>Lady Day</i> and <i>Michaelmas</i>. <i>Per contra</i>, he knows nothing
whatever of our <i>Thanksgiving</i>, <i>Arbor</i>, <i>Labor</i> and <i>Decoration
Days</i>, or of <i>legal holidays</i>, or of <i>Yom Kippur</i>.</p>

<p>In English usage, to proceed, the word <i>directly</i> is always used
to signify <i>immediately</i>; in American a contingency gets into it,
and it may mean no more than <i>soon</i>. In England <i>quite</i> means
"completely, wholly, entirely, altogether, to the utmost extent,
nothing short of, in the fullest sense, positively, absolutely"; in
America it is conditional, and means only nearly, approximately,
substantially, as in "he sings <i>quite</i> well." An Englishman does
not say "I will pay you <i>up</i>" for an injury, but "I will pay you
<i>back</i>." He doesn't look <i>up</i> a definition in a dictionary; he looks
it <i>out</i>. He doesn't say, being ill, "I am <i>getting</i> on well," but <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg115"></a>[Pg115]</span>
"I am <i>going</i> on well." He doesn't use the American "different
<i>from</i>" or "different <i>than</i>"; he uses "different <i>to</i>." He never
adds the pronoun in such locutions as "it hurts <i>me</i>," but says
simply "it hurts." He never "catches <i>up with you</i>" on the
street; he "catches <i>you up</i>." He never says "are you through?"
but "have you finished?" He never uses <i>to notify</i> as a transitive
verb; an official act may be <i>notified</i>, but not a person. He
never uses <i>gotten</i> as the perfect participle of <i>get</i>; he always uses
plain <i>got</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_173" id="FNanchor_17_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_173" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> An English servant never washes the <i>dishes</i>; she
always washes the <i>dinner</i> or <i>tea things</i>. She doesn't <i>live out</i>,
but <i>goes into service</i>. She smashes, not the <i>mirror</i>, but the <i>looking-glass</i>.
Her beau is not her <i>fellow</i>, but her <i>young man</i>. She
does not <i>keep company</i> with him but <i>walks out</i> with him.</p>

<p>That an Englishman always calls out "<i>I</i> say!", and not simply
"say!" when he desires to attract a friend's attention or
register a protestation of incredulity—this perhaps is too familiar
to need notice. His "<i>hear, hear!</i>" and "<i>oh, oh!</i>" are also well
known. He is much less prodigal with <i>good-bye</i> than the American;
he uses <i>good-day</i> and <i>good-afternoon</i> far more often. A
shop-assistant would never say <i>good-bye</i> to a customer. To an
Englishman it would have a subtly offensive smack; <i>good-afternoon</i>
would be more respectful. Another word that makes him
flinch is <i>dirt</i>. He never uses it, as we do, to describe the soil in
the garden; he always says <i>earth</i>. Various very common American
phrases are quite unknown to him, for example, <i>over his
signature</i>, <i>on time</i> and <i>planted to corn</i>. The first-named he never
uses, and he has no equivalent for it; an Englishman who issues
a signed statement simply makes it <i>in writing</i>. He knows nothing
of our common terms of disparagement, such as <i>kike</i>, <i>wop</i>,
<i>yap</i> and <i>rube</i>. His pet-name for a tiller of the soil is not <i>Rube</i>
or <i>Cy</i>, but <i>Hodge</i>. When he goes gunning he does not call it
<i>hunting</i>, but <i>shooting</i>; <i>hunting</i> is reserved for the chase of the
fox.</p>

<p>An intelligent Englishwoman, coming to America to live, told
me that the two things which most impeded her first communications
with untravelled Americans, even above the gross differences <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg116"></a>[Pg116]</span>
between England and American pronunciation and intonation,
were the complete absence of the general utility adjective
<i>jolly</i> from the American vocabulary, and the puzzling omnipresence
and versatility of the American verb <i>to fix</i>. In English
colloquial usage <i>jolly</i> means almost anything; it intensifies all
other adjectives, even including <i>miserable</i> and <i>homesick</i>. An
Englishman is <i>jolly</i> tired, <i>jolly</i> hungry or <i>jolly well</i> tired; his
wife is <i>jolly</i> sensible; his dog is <i>jolly</i> keen; the prices he pays for
things are <i>jolly dear</i> (never <i>steep</i> or <i>stiff</i> or <i>high</i>: all Americanisms).
But he has no noun to match the American <i>proposition</i>,
meaning proposal, business, affair, case, consideration, plan,
theory, solution and what not: only the German <i>zug</i> can be
ranged beside it.<a name="FNanchor_18_174" id="FNanchor_18_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_174" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And he has no verb in such wide practise as
<i>to fix</i>. In his speech it means only to make fast or to determine.
In American it may mean to repair, as in "the plumber <i>fixed</i>
the pipe"; to dress, as in "Mary <i>fixed</i> her hair"; to prepare, as
in "the cook is <i>fixing</i> the gravy"; to bribe, as in "the judge was
<i>fixed</i>"; to settle, as in "the quarrel was <i>fixed</i> up"; to heal, as in
"the doctor <i>fixed</i> his boil"; to finish, as in "Murphy <i>fixed</i>
Sweeney in the third round"; to be well-to-do, as in "John is
well-<i>fixed</i>"; to arrange, as in "I <i>fixed</i> up the quarrel"; to be
drunk, as in "the whiskey <i>fixed</i> him"; to punish, as in "I'll <i>fix</i>
him"; and to correct, as in "he <i>fixed</i> my bad Latin." Moreover,
it is used in all its English senses. An Englishman never
goes to a dentist to have his teeth <i>fixed</i>. He does not <i>fix</i> the
fire; he <i>makes it up</i>, or <i>mends</i> it. He is never <i>well-fixed</i>, either
in money or by liquor.<a name="FNanchor_19_175" id="FNanchor_19_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_175" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The English use <i>quite</i> a great deal more than we do, and,
as we have seen, in a different sense. <i>Quite rich</i>, in American, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg117"></a>[Pg117]</span>
means tolerably rich, richer than most; <i>quite so</i>, in English, is
identical in meaning with <i>exactly so</i>. In American <i>just</i> is almost
equivalent to the English <i>quite</i>, as in <i>just lovely</i>. Thornton
shows that this use of <i>just</i> goes back to 1794. The word is also
used in place of <i>exactly</i> in other ways, as in <i>just in time</i>, <i>just
how many</i> and <i>just what do you mean?</i></p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 3</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Honorifics"></a>Honorifics</h3>—Among the honorifics and euphemisms in everyday
use one finds many notable divergences between the two languages.
On the one hand the English are almost as diligent as
the Germans in bestowing titles of honor upon their men of
mark, and on the other hand they are very careful to withhold
such titles from men who do not legally bear them. In America
every practitioner of any branch of the healing art, even a
chiropodist or an osteopath, is a doctor <i>ipso facto</i>, but in England,
as we have seen, a good many surgeons lack the title and
it is not common in the lesser ranks. Even graduate physicians
may not have it, but here there is a yielding of the usual meticulous
exactness, and it is customary to address a physician in the
second person as <i>Doctor</i>, though his card may show that he is
only <i>Medicinae Baccalaureus</i>, a degree quite unknown in America.
Thus an Englishman, when he is ill, always sends for the
<i>doctor</i>, as we do. But a surgeon is usually plain <i>Mr.</i><a name="FNanchor_20_176" id="FNanchor_20_176"></a><a
href="#Footnote_20_176" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> An
English veterinarian or dentist or druggist or masseur is never
<i>Dr.</i></div>

<p>Nor <i>Professor</i>. In all save a few large cities of America every
male pedagogue is a professor, and so is every band leader,
dancing master and medical consultant. But in England the
title is very rigidly restricted to men who hold chairs in the universities,
a necessarily small body. Even here a superior title <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg118"></a>[Pg118]</span>
always takes precedence. Thus, it used to be <i>Professor</i> Almroth
Wright, but now it is always <i>Sir</i> Almroth Wright. Huxley
was always called <i>Professor</i> Huxley until he was appointed
to the Privy Council. This appointment gave him the right to
have <i>Right Honourable</i> put before his name, and thereafter it
was customary to call him simply <i>Mr.</i> Huxley, with the <i>Right
Honourable</i>, so to speak, floating in the air. The combination,
to an Englishman, was more flattering than <i>Professor</i>, for the
English always esteem political dignities far more than the dignities
of learning. This explains, perhaps, why their universities
distribute so few honorary degrees. In the United States every
respectable Protestant clergyman is a D.D., and it is almost impossible
for a man to get into the papers without becoming an
LL.D.,<a name="FNanchor_21_177" id="FNanchor_21_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_177" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but in England such honors are granted only grudgingly.
So with military titles. To promote a war veteran from
sergeant to colonel by acclamation, as is often done in the United
States, is unknown over there. The English have nothing equivalent
to the gaudy tin soldiers of our governors' staffs, nor to
the bespangled colonels and generals of the Knights Templar
and Patriarchs Militant, nor to the nondescript captains and
majors of our country towns. An English railroad conductor
(<i>railway guard</i>) is never <i>Captain</i>, as he always is in the United
States. Nor are military titles used by the police. Nor is it
the custom to make every newspaper editor a colonel, as is done
south of the Potomac. Nor is an attorney-general or postmaster-general
called <i>General</i>. Nor are the glories of public office, after
they have officially come to an end, embalmed in such clumsy
quasi-titles as <i>ex-United States Senator</i>, <i>ex-Judge of the Circuit
Court of Appeals</i>, <i>ex-Federal Trade Commissioner</i> and <i>former
Chief of the Fire Department</i>.</p>

<p>But perhaps the greatest difference between English and
American usage is presented by <i>the Honorable</i>. In the United
States the title is applied loosely to all public officials of apparent
respectability, from senators and ambassadors to the mayors of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg119"></a>[Pg119]</span>
fifth-rate cities and the members of state legislatures, and with
some show of official sanction to many of them, especially congressmen.
But it is questionable whether this application has
any actual legal standing, save perhaps in the case of certain
judges. Even the President of the United States, by law, is not
<i>the Honorable</i>, but simply <i>the President</i>. In the First Congress
the matter of his title was exhaustively debated; some members
wanted to call him <i>the Honorable</i> and others proposed <i>His Excellency</i>
and even <i>His Highness</i>. But the two Houses finally
decided that it was "not proper to annex any style or title other
than that expressed by the Constitution." Congressmen themselves
are not <i>Honorables</i>. True enough, the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>,
in printing a set speech, calls it "Speech of <i>Hon.</i> John
Jones" (without the <i>the</i> before the <i>Hon.</i>—a characteristic Americanism),
but in reporting the ordinary remarks of a member
it always calls him plain <i>Mr.</i> Nevertheless, a country congressman
would be offended if his partisans, in announcing his appearance
on the stump, did not prefix <i>Hon.</i> to his name. So
would a state senator. So would a mayor or governor. I have
seen the sergeant-at-arms of the United States Senate referred
to as <i>Hon.</i> in the records of that body.<a name="FNanchor_22_178" id="FNanchor_22_178"></a><a
href="#Footnote_22_178" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> More, the prefix is
actually usurped by the Superintendent of State Prisons of New
York.<a name="FNanchor_23_179" id="FNanchor_23_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_179" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In England the thing is more carefully ordered, and bogus
<i>Hons.</i> are unknown. The prefix is applied to both sexes and
belongs by law, <i class="abblatin">inter alia</i>, to all present or past maids of honor,
to all justices of the High Court during their terms of office,
to the Scotch Lords of Session, to the sons and daughters of viscounts
and barons, to the younger sons and all daughters of
earls, and to the members of the legislative and executive councils
of the colonies. But <i>not</i> to members of Parliament, though
each is, in debate, an <i>hon. gentleman</i>. Even a member of the
cabinet is not an <i>Hon.</i>, though he is a <i>Right Hon.</i> by virtue of
membership in the Privy Council, of which the Cabinet is legally
merely a committee. This last honorific belongs, not only to <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg120"></a>[Pg120]</span>
privy councillors, but also to all peers lower than marquesses
(those above are <i>Most Hon.</i>), to Lord Mayors during their terms
of office, to the Lord Advocate and to the Lord Provosts of Edinburgh
and Glasgow. Moreover, a peeress whose husband is a
<i>Right Hon.</i> is a <i>Right Hon.</i> herself.</p>

<p>The British colonies follow the jealous usage of the mother-country.
Even in Canada the lawless American example is not
imitated. I have before me a "Table of Titles to be Used in
Canada," laid down by royal warrant, which lists those who are
<i>Hons.</i> and those who are not <i>Hons.</i> in the utmost detail. Only
privy councillors of Canada (not to be confused with imperial
privy councillors) are permitted to retain the prefix after going
out of office, though ancients who were legislative councillors at
the time of the union, July 1, 1867, may still use it by a sort
of courtesy, and former speakers of the Dominion Senate and
House of Commons and various retired judges may do so on
application to the King, countersigned by the governor-general.
The following are lawfully <i>the Hon.</i>, but only during their
tenure of office: the solicitor-general, the speaker of the House
of Commons, the presidents and speakers of the provincial legislatures,
members of the executive councils of the provinces, the
chief justice, the judges of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts,
the judges of the Supreme Courts of Ontario, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan
and Alberta, the judges of the Courts of Appeal of Manitoba
and British Columbia, the Chancery Court of Prince Edward
Island, and the Circuit Court of Montreal—these, and no
more. A lieutenant-governor of a province is not <i>the Hon.</i>, but
<i>His Honor</i>. The governor-general is <i>His Excellency</i>, and so is
his wife, but in practise they usually have superior honorifics,
and do not forget to demand their use.</p>

<p>But though an Englishman, and, following him, a colonial,
is thus very careful to restrict <i>the Hon.</i> to proper uses, he always
insists, when he serves without pay as an officer of any
organization, to indicate his volunteer character by writing <i>Hon.</i>
before the name of his office. If he leaves it off it is a sign
that he is a hireling. Thus, the agent of the New Zealand <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg121"></a>[Pg121]</span>
government in London, a paid officer, is simply the <i>agent</i>, but
the agents at Brisbane and Adelaide, in Australia, who serve
for the glory of it, are <i>hon. agents</i>. In writing to a Briton one
must be careful to put <i>Esq.</i>, behind his name, and not <i>Mr.</i>, before
it. The English make a clear distinction between the two forms.
<i>Mr.</i>, on an envelope, indicates that the sender holds the receiver
to be his inferior; one writes to <i>Mr.</i> John Jackson, one's green-grocer,
but to James Thompson, <i>Esq.</i>, one's neighbor. Any man
who is entitled to the <i>Esq.</i> is a <i>gentleman</i>, by which an Englishman
means a man of sound connections and dignified occupation—in
brief, of ponderable social position. Thus a dentist,
a shop-keeper or a clerk can never be a gentleman in England,
even by courtesy, and the qualifications of an author, a musical
conductor, a physician, or even a member of Parliament have
to be established. But though he is thus enormously watchful
of masculine dignity, an Englishman is quite careless in the use
of <i>lady</i>. He speaks glibly of <i>lady-clerks</i>, <i>lady-typists</i>, <i>lady-doctors</i>
and <i>lady-inspectors</i>. In America there is a strong disposition
to use the word less and less, as is revealed by the substitution
of <i>saleswoman</i> and <i>salesgirl</i> for the <i>saleslady</i> of yesteryear.
But in England <i>lady</i> is still invariably used instead of
woman in such compounds as <i>lady-golfer</i>, <i>lady-secretary</i> and
<i>lady-champion</i>. The <i>women's singles</i>, in England tennis, are
always <i>ladies' singles</i>; <i>women's wear</i>, in English shops, is always
<i>ladies' wear</i>. Perhaps the cause of this distinction between
<i>lady</i> and <i>gentleman</i> has been explained by Price Collier in
"England and the English." In England, according to Collier,
the male is always first. His comfort goes before his wife's
comfort, and maybe his dignity also. <i>Gentleman-clerk</i> or <i>gentleman-author</i>
would make an Englishman howl, though he uses
<i>gentleman-rider</i>. So would the growing American custom of
designating the successive heirs of a private family by the
numerals proper to royalty. John Smith <i>3rd</i> and William Simpson
<i>IV</i> are gravely received at Harvard; at Oxford they would
be ragged unmercifully.</p>

<p>An Englishman, in speaking or writing of public officials,
avoids those long and clumsy combinations of title and name <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg122"></a>[Pg122]</span>
which figure so copiously in American newspapers. Such locutions
as <i>Assistant Secretary of the Interior</i> Jones, <i>Fourth Assistant
Postmaster-General</i> Brown, <i>Inspector of Boilers</i> Smith,
<i>Judge of the Appeal Tax Court</i> Robinson, <i>Chief Clerk of the
Treasury</i> Williams and <i>Collaborating Epidermologist</i> White<a name="FNanchor_24_180" id="FNanchor_24_180"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24_180" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
are quite unknown to him. When he mentions a high official,
such as the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, he does not think it
necessary to add the man's name; he simply says "the Secretary
for Foreign Affairs" or "the Foreign Secretary." And so
with the Lord Chancellor, the Chief Justice, the Prime Minister,
the Bishop of Carlisle, the Chief Rabbi, the First Lord (of the
Admiralty), the Master of Pembroke (College), the Italian Ambassador,
and so on. Certain ecclesiastical titles are sometimes
coupled to surnames in the American manner, as in <i>Dean Stanley</i>,
and <i>Canon Wilberforce</i>, but <i>Prime Minister Lloyd-George</i>
would seem heavy and absurd. But in other directions the Englishman
has certain clumsinesses of his own. Thus, in writing
a letter to a relative stranger, he sometimes begins it, not <i>My
dear Mr. Jones</i> but <i>My dear John Joseph Jones</i>. He may even
use such a form as <i>My dear Secretary for War</i> in place of the
American <i>My dear Mr. Secretary</i>. In English usage, incidentally,
<i>My dear</i> is more formal than simply <i>Dear</i>. In America,
of course, this distinction is lost, and such forms as <i>My dear
John Joseph Jones</i> appear only as conscious imitations of English
usage.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the American custom of dropping the definite
article before <i>Hon.</i> It extends to <i>Rev.</i> and the like, and has
the authority of very respectable usage behind it. The opening
sentence of the <cite>Congressional Record</cite> is always: "The Chaplain,
<i>Rev.</i>————, D.D., offered the following prayer."
When chaplains for the army or navy are confirmed by the Senate
they always appear in the <cite>Record</cite> as <i>Revs.</i>, never as <i>the Revs.</i>
I also find the honorific without the article in the New International
Encyclopaedia, in the <cite>World</cite> Almanac, and in a widely-popular <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg123"></a>[Pg123]</span>
American grammar-book.<a name="FNanchor_25_181" id="FNanchor_25_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_181" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> So long ago as 1867, Gould
protested against this elision as barbarous and idiotic, and drew
up the following <i class="abblatin">reductio ad absurdum</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>At last annual meeting of Black Book Society, honorable John Smith
took the chair, assisted by reverend John Brown and venerable John
White. The office of secretary would have been filled by late John
Green, but for his decease, which rendered him ineligible. His place
was supplied by inevitable John Black. In the course of the evening
eulogiums were pronounced on distinguished John Gray and notorious
Joseph Brown. Marked compliment was also paid to able historian
Joseph White, discriminating philosopher Joseph Green, and learned
professor Joseph Black. But conspicuous speech of the evening was
witty Joseph Gray's apostrophe to eminent astronomer Jacob Brown,
subtle logician Jacob White, etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_26_182"

<p>Richard Grant White, a year or two later, joined the attack
in the New York <i>Galaxy</i>, and William Cullen Bryant included
the omission of the article in his <cite>Index Expurgatorius</cite>, but these
anathemas were as ineffective as Gould's irony. The more careful
American journals, of course, incline to the <i>the</i>, and I note
that it is specifically ordained on the Style-sheet of the <cite>Century
Magazine</cite>, but the overwhelming majority of American newspapers
get along without it, and I have often noticed its omission
on the sign-boards at church entrances.<a name="FNanchor_27_183" id="FNanchor_27_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_183" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In England it

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Euphemisms_and_Forbidden_Words"></a>Euphemisms and Forbidden Words</h3>—But such euphemisms as
<i>lady-clerk</i> are, after all, much rarer in English than in American
usage. The Englishman seldom tries to gloss menial occupations
with sonorous names; on the contrary, he seems to delight
in keeping their menial character plain. He says <i>servants</i>, not
<i>help</i>. Even his railways and banks have <i>servants</i>; the chief
trades-union of the English railroad men is the Amalgamated
Society of Railway <i>Servants</i>. He uses <i>employé</i> in place of <i>clerk</i>,
<i>workman</i> or <i>laborer</i> much less often than we do. True enough
he calls a boarder a <i>paying-guest</i>, but that is probably because
even a boarder may be a gentleman. Just as he avoids calling
a fast train the <i>limited</i>, the <i>flier</i> or the <i>cannon-ball</i>, so he never
calls an <i>undertaker</i> a <i>funeral director</i> or <i>mortician</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_184" id="FNanchor_28_184"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_184" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> or a <i>dentist</i>
a <i>dental surgeon</i> or <i>ontologist</i>, or an <i>optician</i> an <i>optometrist</i>,
or a <i>barber shop</i> (he always makes it <i>barber's shop</i>) a <i>tonsorial

a <i>buffet</i> or a <i>hotel</i>, or a tradesman a <i>storekeeper</i> or

in England, always means a collection of colleges.<a name="FNanchor_29_185" id="FNanchor_29_185"></a><a

manager</i> for <i>floor-walker</i> (he makes it <i>shop-walker</i>), <i>loan-office</i>
for <i>pawn-shop</i>. Also, he is careful not to use such words as
<i>rector</i>, <i>deacon</i> and <i>baccalaureate</i> in merely rhetorical senses.<a name="FNanchor_30_186" id="FNanchor_30_186"></a><a

<p>When we come to words, that, either intrinsically or by usage,
are improper, a great many curious differences between English
and American reveal themselves. The Englishman, on the whole,
is more plain-spoken than the American, and such terms as
<i>bitch</i>, <i>mare</i> and <i>in foal</i> do not commonly daunt him, largely, perhaps,
because of his greater familiarity with country life; but
he has a formidable index of his own, and it includes such essentially
harmless words as <i>sick</i>, <i>stomach</i>, <i>bum</i> and <i>bug</i>. The English
use of <i>ill</i> for <i>sick</i> I have already noticed, and the reasons
for the English avoidance of <i>bum</i>. <i>Sick</i>, over there, means
nauseated, and when an Englishman says that he was <i>sick</i> he
means that he vomited, or, as an American would say, was
<i>sick at the stomach</i>. The older (and still American) usage,
however, survives in various compounds. <i>Sick-list</i>, for example,
is official in the Navy,<a name="FNanchor_31_187" id="FNanchor_31_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_187" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and <i>sick-leave</i> is known in the Army,
though it is more common to say of a soldier that he is <i>invalided
home</i>. <i>Sick-room</i> and <i>sick-bed</i> are also in common use, and
<i>sick-flag</i> is used in place of the American <i>quarantine-flag</i>. But
an Englishman hesitates to mention his stomach in the presence
of ladies, though he discourses freely about his liver. To avoid
the necessity he employs such euphemisms as <i>Little Mary</i>. As
for <i>bug</i>, he restricts its use very rigidly to the <i>Cimex lectularius</i>,
or common bed-bug, and hence the word has a highly impolite
connotation. All other crawling things he calls <i>insects</i>. An
American of my acquaintance once greatly offended an English
friend by using <i>bug</i> for <i>insect</i>. The two were playing billiards
one summer evening in the Englishman's house, and various
flying things came through the window and alighted on the
cloth. The American, essaying a shot, remarked that he had
killed a <i>bug</i> with his cue. To the Englishman this seemed a
slanderous reflection upon the cleanliness of his house.<a name="FNanchor_32_188" id="FNanchor_32_188"></a><a
href="#Footnote_32_188" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg126"></a>[Pg126]</span></p>

<p>The Victorian era saw a great growth of absurd euphemisms
in England, including <i>second wing</i> for the leg of a fowl, but it
was in America that the thing was carried farthest. Bartlett
hints that <i>rooster</i> came into use in place of <i>cock</i> as a matter of
delicacy, the latter word having acquired an indecent significance,
and tells us that, at one time, even <i>bull</i> was banned as
too vulgar for refined ears. In place of it the early purists
used <i>cow-creature</i>, <i>male-cow</i> and even <i>gentleman-cow</i>.<a name="FNanchor_33_189" id="FNanchor_33_189"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_189" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> <i>Bitch</i>,
<i>ram</i>, <i>buck</i> and <i>sow</i> went the same way, and there was a day when
even <i>mare</i> was prohibited. Bache tells us that <i>pismire</i> was also
banned, <i>antmire</i> being substituted for it. In 1847 the word
<i>chair</i> was actually barred out and <i>seat</i> was adopted in its place.<a name="FNanchor_34_190" id="FNanchor_34_190"></a><a
href="#Footnote_34_190" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
These were the palmy days of euphemism. The delicate <i>female</i>
was guarded from all knowledge, and even from all suspicion,
of evil. "To utter aloud in her presence the word <i>shirt</i>," says
one historian, "was an open insult."<a name="FNanchor_35_191" id="FNanchor_35_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_191" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Mrs. Trollope, writing
in 1832, tells of "a young German gentleman of perfectly good
manners" who "offended one of the principal families ... by
having pronounced the word <i>corset</i> before the ladies of it."<a name="FNanchor_36_192" id="FNanchor_36_192"></a><a
href="#Footnote_36_192" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The word <i>woman</i>, in those sensitive days, became a term of reproach,
comparable to the German <i>mensch</i>; the uncouth <i>female</i>
took its place.<a name="FNanchor_37_193" id="FNanchor_37_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_193" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In the same way the legs of the fair became
<i>limbs</i> and their breasts <i>bosoms</i>, and <i>lady</i> was substituted for
<i>wife</i>. <i>Stomach</i>, under the ban in England, was transformed,
by some unfathomable magic, into a euphemism denoting the
whole region from the nipples to the pelvic arch. It was during <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg127"></a>[Pg127]</span>
this time that the newspapers invented such locutions as <i>interesting</i>
(or <i>delicate</i>) <i>condition</i>, <i>criminal operation</i>, <i>house of ill</i>
(or <i>questionable</i>) <i>repute</i>, <i>disorderly-house</i>, <i>sporting-house</i>, <i>statutory
offense</i>, <i>fallen woman</i> and <i>criminal assault</i>. Servant girls
ceased to be seduced, and began to be <i>betrayed</i>. Various French
terms, <i>enceinte</i> and <i>accouchement</i> among them, were imported to
conceal the fact that lawful wives occasionally became pregnant
and had lyings-in.</p>

<p>White, between 1867 and 1870, launched various attacks upon
these ludicrous gossamers of speech, and particularly upon <i>enceinte</i>,
<i>limb</i> and <i>female</i>, but only <i>female</i> succumbed. The passage
of the notorious Comstock Postal Act, in 1873, greatly
stimulated the search for euphemisms. Once that act was upon
the statute-books and Comstock himself was given the amazingly
inquisitorial powers of a post-office inspector, it became positively
dangerous to print certain ancient and essentially decent
English words. To this day the effects of that old reign of
terror are still visible. We yet use <i>toilet</i> and <i>public comfort
station</i> in place of better terms,<a name="FNanchor_38_194" id="FNanchor_38_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_194" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and such idiotic forms as <i>red-light
district</i>, <i>disorderly-house</i>, <i>blood-poison</i>, <i>social-evil</i>, <i>social
disease</i> and <i>white slave</i> ostensibly conceal what every flapper
is talking about. The word <i>cadet</i>, having a foreign smack and
an innocent native meaning, is preferred to the more accurate
<i>procurer</i>; even prostitutes shrink from the forthright <i>pimp</i>, and
employ a characteristic American abbreviation, <i>P. I.</i>—a curious
brother to <i>S. O. B.</i> and <i>2 o'clock</i>. Nevertheless, a movement
toward honesty is getting on its legs. The vice crusaders, if they
have accomplished nothing else, have at least forced the newspapers
to use the honest terms, <i>syphilis</i>, <i>prostitute</i>, <i>brothel</i> and
<i>venereal disease</i>, albeit somewhat gingerly. It is, perhaps, significant
of the change going on that the <cite>New York Evening Post</cite> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg128"></a>[Pg128]</span>
recently authorized its reporters to use <i>street-walker</i>.<a name="FNanchor_39_195" id="FNanchor_39_195"></a><a
href="#Footnote_39_195" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But in
certain quarters the change is viewed with alarm, and curious
traces of the old prudery still survive. The Department of
Health of New York City, in April, 1914, announced that its
efforts to diminish venereal disease were much handicapped
because "in most newspaper offices the words <i>syphilis</i> and
<i>gonorrhea</i> are still tabooed, and without the use of these terms
it is almost impossible to correctly state the problem." The
Army Medical Corps, in the early part of 1918, encountered the
same difficulty: most newspapers refused to print its bulletins
regarding venereal disease in the army. One of the newspaper
trade journals thereupon sought the opinions of editors upon
the subject, and all of them save one declared against the use
of the two words. One editor put the blame upon the Postoffice,
which still cherishes the Comstock tradition. Another
reported that "at a recent conference of the Scripps Northwest
League editors" it was decided that "the use of such terms as
<i>gonorrhea</i>, <i>syphilis</i>, and even <i>venereal diseases</i> would not add to
the tone of the papers, and that the term <i>vice diseases</i> can be
readily substituted."<a name="FNanchor_40_196" id="FNanchor_40_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_196" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The Scripps papers are otherwise anything
but distinguished for their "tone," but in this department
they yield to the Puritan habit. An even more curious instance
of prudery came to my notice in Philadelphia several years ago.
A one-act play of mine, "The Artist," was presented at the
Little Theatre there, and during its run, on February 26, 1916,
the <cite>Public Ledger</cite> reprinted some of the dialogue. One of the
characters in the piece is <i>A Virgin</i>. At every occurrence a
change was made to <i>A Young Girl</i>. Apparently, even <i>virgin</i>
is still regarded as too frank in Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_41_197" id="FNanchor_41_197"></a><a
href="#Footnote_41_197" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Fifty years <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg129"></a>[Pg129]</span>
ago the very word <i>decent</i> was indecent in the South: no respectable
woman was supposed to have any notion of the difference
between <i>decent</i> and <i>indecent</i>.</p>

<p>In their vocabularies of opprobrium and profanity English
and Americans diverge sharply. The English <i>rotter</i> and <i>blighter</i>
are practically unknown in America, and there are various American
equivalents that are never heard in England. A <i>guy</i>, in
the American vulgate, simply signifies a man; there is not necessarily
any disparaging significance. But in English, high or
low, it means one who is making a spectacle of himself. The
derivative verb, <i>to guy</i>, is unknown in English; its nearest
equivalent is <i>to spoof</i>, which is unknown in American. The
average American, I believe, has a larger vocabulary of profanity
than the average Englishman, and swears a good deal
more, but he attempts an amelioration of many of his oaths by
softening them to forms with no apparent meaning. <i>Darn</i>
(=<i>dern</i>=<i>durn</i>) for <i>damn</i> is apparently of English origin,
but it is heard ten thousand times in America to once in England.
So is <i>dog-gone</i>. Such euphemistic written forms as
<i>damphool</i> and <i>damfino</i> are also far more common in this country.
<i>All-fired</i> for <i>hell-fired</i>, <i>gee-whiz</i> for <i>Jesus</i>, <i>tarnal</i> for <i>eternal</i>,
<i>tarnation</i> for <i>damnation</i>, <i>cuss</i> for <i>curse</i>, <i>goldarned</i> for <i>God-damned</i>,
<i>by gosh</i> for <i>by God</i> and <i>great Scott</i> for <i>great God</i> are
all Americanisms; Thornton has traced <i>all-fired</i> to 1835, <i>tarnation</i>
to 1801 and <i>tarnal</i> to 1790. <i>By golly</i> has been found in
English literature so early as 1843, but it probably originated
in America; down to the Civil War it was the characteristic
oath of the negro slaves. Such terms as <i>bonehead</i>, <i>pinhead</i> and
<i>boob</i> have been invented, perhaps, to take the place of the English
<i>ass</i>, which has a flavor of impropriety in America on account
of its identity in sound with the American pronunciation of
<i>arse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_42_198" id="FNanchor_42_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_198" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> At an earlier day <i>ass</i> was always differentiated by making
it <i>jackass</i>. Another word that is improper in America but
not in England is <i>tart</i>. To an Englishman the word connotes
sweetness, and so, if he be of the lower orders, he may apply <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg130"></a>[Pg130]</span>
it to his sweetheart. But to the American it signifies a prostitute,
or, at all events, a woman of too ready an amiability.</p>

<p>But the most curious disparity between the profane vocabulary
of the two tongues is presented by <i>bloody</i>. This word is
entirely without improper significance in America, but in England
it is regarded as the vilest of indecencies. The sensation
produced in London when George Bernard Shaw put it into the
mouth of a woman character in his play, "Pygmalion," will
be remembered. "The interest in the first English performance,"
said the <cite>New York Times</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_43_199"
id="FNanchor_43_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_199"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> "centered in the heroine's
utterance of this banned word. It was waited for with trembling,
heard shudderingly, and presumably, when the shock
subsided, interest dwindled." But in New York, of course, it
failed to cause any stir. Just why it is regarded as profane
and indecent by the English is one of the mysteries of the language.
The theory that it has some blasphemous reference to
the blood of Christ is disputed by many etymologists. It came
in during the latter half of the seventeenth century, and at the
start it apparently meant no more than "in the manner of a
blood," <i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, a rich young roisterer of the time. Thus, <i>bloody
drunk</i> was synonymous with as <i>drunk as a lord</i>. The adjective
remained innocuous for 200 years. Then it suddenly acquired its
present abhorrent significance. It is regarded with such aversion
by the English that even the lower orders often substitute
<i>bleeding</i> as a euphemism.</p>

<p>So far no work devoted wholly to the improper terms of English
and American has been published, but this lack may be soon
remedied by a compilation made by a Chicago journalist. It is
entitled "The Slang of Venery and Its Analogues," and runs
to two large volumes. A small edition, mimeographed for private
circulation, was issued in 1916. I have examined this work
and found it of great value. If the influence of comstockery is
sufficient to prevent its publication in the United States, as seems
likely, it will be printed in Switzerland.</p>

International Exchanges</h3>
—More than once, during the preceding
chapters, we encountered Americanisms that had gone
over into English, and English locutions that had begun to get
a foothold in the United States. Such exchanges are made very
frequently and often very quickly, and though the guardians
of English still attack every new Americanism vigorously, even
when, as in the case of <i>scientist</i>, it is obviously sound and useful,
they are often routed by public pressure, and have to submit
in the end with the best grace possible. For example, consider
<i>caucus</i>. It originated in Boston at some indeterminate
time before 1750, and remained so peculiarly American for
more than a century following that most of the English visitors
before the Civil War remarked its use. But, according to J.
Redding Ware,<a name="FNanchor_1_200" id="FNanchor_1_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_200" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it began to creep into English political slang
about 1870, and in the 80's it was lifted to good usage by the
late Joseph Chamberlain. Ware, writing in the first years of
the present century, said that the word had become "very important"
in England, but was "not admitted into dictionaries."
But in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, dated 1914, it is given
as a sound English word, though its American origin is noted.
The English, however, use it in a sense that has become archaic
in America, thus preserving an abandoned American meaning
in the same way that many abandoned British meanings have
been preserved on this side. In the United States the word
means, and has meant for years, a meeting of some division, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg132"></a>[Pg132]</span>
large or small, of a political or legislative body for the purpose
of agreeing upon a united course of action in the main assembly.
In England it means the managing committee of a party or fraction—something
corresponding to our national committee, or
state central committee, or steering committee, or to the half-forgotten
congressional caucuses of the 20's. It has a disparaging
significance over there, almost equal to that of our words
<i>organization</i> and <i>machine</i>. Moreover, it has given birth to two
derivatives of like quality, both unknown in America—<i>caucusdom</i>,
meaning machine control, and <i>caucuser</i>, meaning a machine
politician.<a name="FNanchor_2_201" id="FNanchor_2_201"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2_201" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>

<p>A good many other such Americanisms have got into good
usage in England, and new ones are being exported constantly.
Farmer describes the process of their introduction, and assimilation.
American books, newspapers and magazines, especially
the last, circulate in England in large number, and some of their
characteristic locutions pass into colloquial speech. Then they
get into print, and begin to take on respectability. "The phrase,
'as the Americans say,'" he continues, "might in some cases
be ordered from the type foundry as a logotype, so frequently
does it do introduction duty."<a name="FNanchor_3_202" id="FNanchor_3_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_202" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Ware shows another means of
ingress: the argot of sailors. Many of the Americanisms he
notes as having become naturalized in England, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>boodle</i>,
<i>boost</i> and <i>walk-out</i>, are credited to Liverpool as a sort of half-way
station. Travel brings in still more: England swarms
with Americans, and Englishmen themselves, visiting America,
bring home new and racy phrases. Bishop Coxe says<a name="FNanchor_4_203" id="FNanchor_4_203"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_203" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg133"></a>[Pg133]</span>
Dickens, in his "American Notes," gave English currency to
<i>reliable</i>, <i>influential</i>, <i>talented</i> and <i>lengthy</i>. Bristed, writing in
1855, said that <i>talented</i> was already firmly fixed in the English
vocabulary by that time. All four words are in the Concise
Oxford Dictionary, and only <i>lengthy</i> is noted as "originally an
Americanism." Finally, there is the influence of the moving
pictures. Hundreds of American films are shown in England
every week, and the American words and phrases appearing in
their titles, sub-titles and other explanatory legends thus become
familiar to the English. "The patron of the picture palace,"
says W. G. Faulkner, in an article in the <cite>London Daily
Mail</cite>, "learns to think of his railway station as a <i>depot</i>; he has
alternatives to one of our newest words, <i>hooligan</i>, in <i>hoodlum</i>
and <i>tough</i>; he watches a <i>dive</i>, which is a thieves' kitchen or a
room in which bad characters meet, and whether the villain
talks of <i>dough</i> or <i>sugar</i> he knows it is money to which he is
referring. The musical ring of the word <i>tramp</i> gives way to
the stodgy <i>hobo</i> or <i>dead-beat</i>. It may be that the plot reveals
an attempt to deceive some simple-minded person. If it does,
the innocent one is spoken of as a <i>sucker</i>, a <i>come-on</i>, a <i>boob</i>, or
a <i>lobster</i> if he is stupid into the bargain."</p>

<p>Mr. Faulkner goes on to say that a great many other Americanisms
are constantly employed by Englishmen "who have not
been affected by the avalanche ... which has come upon us
through the picture palace." "Thus today," he says, "we hear
people speak of the <i>fall</i> of the year, a <i>stunt</i> they have in hand,
their desire to <i>boost</i> a particular business, a <i>peach</i> when they
mean a pretty girl, a <i>scab</i>—a common term among strikers,—the
<i>glad-eye</i>, <i>junk</i> when they mean worthless material, their efforts
<i>to make good</i>, the <i>elevator</i> in the hotel or office, the <i>boss</i> or manager,
the <i>crook</i> or swindler; and they will tell you that they have
the <i>goods</i>—that is, they possess the requisite qualities for a
given position." The venerable Frederic Harrison, writing in
the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite> in the Spring of 1918, denounced this
tendency with a vigor recalling the classical anathemas of Dean
Alford and Sydney Smith.<a name="FNanchor_5_204" id="FNanchor_5_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_204" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "Stale American phrases, ..." <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg134"></a>[Pg134]</span>
he said, "are infecting even our higher journalism and our parliamentary
and platform oratory.... A statesman is now <i>out</i>
for victory; he is <i>up against</i> pacificism.... He has a <i>card up
his sleeve</i>, by which the enemy are at last to be <i>euchred</i>. Then
a fierce fight in which hundreds of noble fellows are mangled
or drowned is a <i>scrap</i>.... To criticise a politician is to call
for his <i>scalp</i>.... The other fellow is beaten to a <i>frazzle</i>."
And so on. "Bolshevism," concluded Harrison sadly, "is ruining
language as well as society."</p>

<p>But though there are still many such alarms by constables of
the national speech, the majority of Englishmen continue to
make borrowings from the tempting and ever-widening American
vocabulary. What is more, some of these loan-words take
root, and are presently accepted as sound English, even by the
most watchful. The two Fowlers, in "The King's English,"
separate Americanisms from other current vulgarisms, but many
of the latter on their list are actually American in origin, though
they do not seem to know it—for example, <i>to demean</i> and <i>to
transpire</i>. More remarkable still, the Cambridge History of
English Literature lists <i>backwoodsman</i>, <i>know-nothing</i> and <i>yellow-back</i>
as English compounds, apparently in forgetfulness of
their American origin, and adds <i>skunk</i>, <i>squaw</i> and <i>toboggan</i> as
direct importations from the Indian tongues, without noting that
they came through American, and remained definite Americanisms
for a long while.<a name="FNanchor_6_205" id="FNanchor_6_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_205" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It even adds <i>musquash</i>, a popular name
for the <i>Fiber zibethicus</i>, borrowed from the Algonquin <i>muskwessu</i>
but long since degenerated to <i>musk-rat</i> in America.
<i>Musquash</i> has been in disuse in this country, indeed, since the
middle of the last century, save as a stray localism, but the
English have preserved it, and it appears in the Oxford Dictionary.<a name="FNanchor_7_206" id="FNanchor_7_206"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_206" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A few weeks in London or a month's study of the London <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg135"></a>[Pg135]</span>
newspapers will show a great many other American pollutions
of the well of English. The argot of politics is full of them.
Many beside <i>caucus</i> were introduced by Joseph Chamberlain, a
politician skilled in American campaign methods and with an
American wife to prompt him. He gave the English their first
taste of <i>to belittle</i>, one of the inventions of Thomas Jefferson.
<i>Graft</i> and <i>to graft</i> crossed the ocean in their nonage. <i>To bluff</i>
has been well understood in England for 30 years. It is in
Cassell's and the Oxford Dictionaries, and has been used by no
less a magnifico than Sir Almroth Wright.<a name="FNanchor_8_207" id="FNanchor_8_207"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_207" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> <i>To stump</i>, in the
form of <i>stump-oratory</i>, is in Carlyle's "Latter-Day Pamphlets,"
<i class="abblatin">circa</i> 1850, and <i>caucus</i> appears in his "Frederick the Great;"<a name="FNanchor_9_208" id="FNanchor_9_208"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9_208" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
though, as we have seen on the authority of Ware, it did
not come into general use in England until ten years later.
<i>Buncombe</i> (usually spelled <i>bunkum</i>) is in all the later English
dictionaries. In the London stock market and among English
railroad men various characteristic Americanisms have got a foothold.
The meaning of <i>bucket-shop</i> and <i>to water</i>, for example,
is familiar to every London broker's clerk. English trains are
now <i>telescoped</i> and carry <i>dead-heads</i>, and in 1913 a rival to the
Amalgamated Order of Railway <i>Servants</i> was organized under
the name of the National Union of <i>Railway Men</i>. The beginnings
of a movement against the use of <i>servant</i> are visible in
other directions, and the American <i>help</i> threatens to be substituted;
at all events, <i>Help Wanted</i> advertisements are now occasionally
encountered in English newspapers. But it is American
verbs that seem to find the way into English least difficult,
particularly those compounded with prepositions and adverbs,
such as <i>to pan out</i> and <i>to swear off</i>. Most of them, true enough, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg136"></a>[Pg136]</span>
are still used as conscious Americanisms, but used they are,
and with increasing frequency. The highly typical American
verb <i>to loaf</i> is now naturalized, and Ware says that <i>The Loaferies</i>
is one of the common nicknames of the Whitechapel workhouse.</p>

<p>It is curious, reading the fulminations of American purists of
the last generation, to note how many of the Americanisms they
denounced have not only got into perfectly good usage at home
but even broken down all guards across the ocean. <i>To placate</i>
and <i>to antagonize</i> are examples. The Oxford Dictionary distinguishes
between the English and American meanings of the
latter: in England a man may antagonize only another man, in
America he may antagonize a mere idea or thing. But, as the
brothers Fowler show, even the English meaning is of American
origin, and no doubt a few more years will see the verb completely
naturalized in Britain. <i>To placate</i>, attacked vigorously
by all native grammarians down to (but excepting) White, now
has the authority of the <cite>Spectator</cite>, and is accepted by Cassell.
<i>To donate</i> is still under the ban, but <i>to transpire</i> has been used
by the <cite>London Times</cite>. Other old bugaboos that have been embraced
are <i>gubernatorial</i>, <i>presidential</i> and <i>standpoint</i>. White labored
long and valiantly to convince Americans that the adjective
derived from <i>president</i> should be without the <i>i</i> in its last
syllable, following the example of <i>incidental</i>, <i>regimental</i>, <i>monumental</i>,
<i>governmental</i>, <i>oriental</i>, <i>experimental</i> and so on; but in
vain, for <i>presidential</i> is now perfectly good English. <i>To demean</i>
is still questioned, but English authors of the first rank
have used it, and it will probably lose its dubious character very
soon.</p>

<p>The flow of loan-words in the opposite direction meets with
little impediment, for social distinction in America is still largely
dependent upon English recognition, and so there is an eager
imitation of the latest English fashions in speech. This emulation
is most noticeable in the large cities of the East, and particularly
in what Schele de Vere called "Boston and the Boston
dependencies." New York is but little behind. The small
stores there, if they are of any pretentions, are now almost invariably
called <i>shops</i>. Shoes for the well-to-do are no longer <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg137"></a>[Pg137]</span>
<i>shoes</i>, but <i>boots</i>, and they are sold in <i>bootshops</i>. One encounters,
too, in the side-streets off Fifth avenue, a multitude of <i>gift-shops</i>,
<i>tea-shops</i> and <i>haberdashery-shops</i>. In Fifth avenue itself there
are several <i>luggage-shops</i>. In August, 1917, signs appeared in
the New York surface cars in which the conductors were referred
to as <i>guards</i>. This effort to be English and correct was
exhibited over the sign manual of Theodore P. Shonts, president
of the Interborough, a gentleman of Teutonic name, but evidently
a faithful protector of the king's English. On the same
cars, however, painted notices, surviving from some earlier
régime, mentioned the guards as <i>conductors</i>. <i>To Let</i> signs are
now as common in all our cities as <i>For Rent</i> signs. We all
know the <i>charwoman</i>, and have begun to forget our native modification
of <i>char</i>, to wit, <i>chore</i>. Every apartment-house has a
<i>tradesmen's-entrance</i>. In Charles street, in Baltimore, some
time ago, the proprietor of a fashionable stationery store directed
me, not to the elevator, but to the <i>lift</i>.</p>

<p>Occasionally, some uncompromising patriot raises his voice
against these importations, but he seldom shows the vigorous
indignation of the English purists, and he seldom prevails.
White, in 1870, warned Americans against the figurative use of
<i>nasty</i> as a synonym for <i>disagreeable</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_209" id="FNanchor_10_209"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10_209" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This use of the word
was then relatively new in England, though, according to White,
the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> and the <cite>Spectator</cite> had already succumbed.
His objections to it were unavailing; <i>nasty</i> quickly got into
American and has been there ever since. In 1883 Gilbert M.
Tucker protested against <i>good-form</i>, <i>traffic</i> (in the sense of
travel), <i>to bargain</i> and <i>to tub</i> as Briticisms that we might well
do without, but all of them took root and are perfectly sound
American today. There is, indeed, no intelligible reason why
such English inventions and improvements should not be taken
in, even though the motive behind the welcome to them may
occasionally cause a smile. English, after all, is the mother of
American, and the child, until lately, was still at nurse. The
English, confronted by some of our fantastic innovations, may
well regard them as impudences to be put down, but what they <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg138"></a>[Pg138]</span>
offer in return often fits into our vocabulary without offering
it any outrage. American, indeed, is full of lingering Briticisms,
all maintaining a successful competition with native forms. If
we take back <i>shop</i> it is merely taking back something that <i>store</i>
has never been able to rid us of: we use <i>shop-worn</i>, <i>shoplifter</i>,
<i>shopping</i>, <i>shopper</i>, <i>shop-girl</i> and <i>to shop</i> every day. In the
same way the word <i>penny</i> has survived among us, despite the
fact that there has been no American coin of that name for
more than 125 years. We have <i>nickel-in-the-slot</i> machines, but
when they take a cent we call them <i>penny-in-the-slot</i> machines.
We have <i>penny-arcades</i> and <i>penny-whistles</i>. We do not play
<i>cent</i>-ante, but <i>penny</i>-ante. We still "turn an honest <i>penny</i>"
and say "a <i>penny</i> for your thoughts." The pound and the
shilling became extinct a century ago, but the penny still binds
us to the mother tongue.</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Points_of_Difference"></a>Points of Difference</h3>—These exchanges and coalescences, however,
though they invigorate each language with the blood of
the other and are often very striking in detail, are neither
numerous enough nor general enough to counteract the centrifugal
force which pulls them apart. The simple fact is that
the spirit of English and the spirit of American have been at
odds for nearly a century, and that the way of one is not the
way of the other. The loan-words that fly to and fro, when
examined closely, are found to be few in number both relatively
and absolutely: they do not greatly affect the larger movements
of the two languages. Many of them, indeed, are little more
than temporary borrowings; they are not genuinely adopted, but
merely momentarily fashionable. The class of Englishmen which
affects American phrases is perhaps but little larger, taking one
year with another, than the class of Americans which affects
English phrases. This last class, it must be plain, is very small.
Leave the large cities and you will have difficulty finding any
members of it. It is circumscribed, not because there is any
very formidable prejudice against English locutions as such, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg139"></a>[Pg139]</span>
but simply because recognizably English locutions, in a good
many cases, do not fit into the American language. The American
thinks in American and the Englishman in English, and it
requires a definite effort, usually but defectively successful, for
either to put his thoughts into the actual idiom of the other.</div>

<p>The difficulties of this enterprise are well exhibited, though
quite unconsciously, by W. L. George in a chapter entitled "Litany
of the Novelist" in his book of criticism, "Literary Chapters."<a name="FNanchor_11_210" id="FNanchor_11_210"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11_210" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
This chapter, it is plain by internal evidence, was
written, not for Englishmen, but for Americans. A good part
of it, in fact, is in the second person—we are addressed and
argued with directly. And throughout there is an obvious endeavor
to help out comprehension by a studied use of purely
American phrases and examples. One hears, not of the <i>East
End</i>, but of the <i>East Side</i>; not of the <i>City</i>, but of <i>Wall Street</i>;
not of <i>Belgravia</i> or the <i>West End</i>, but of <i>Fifth avenue</i>; not of
<i>bowler</i> hats, but of <i>Derbys</i>; not of idlers in <i>pubs</i>, but of <i>saloon
loafers</i>; not of <i>pounds</i>, <i>shillings</i> and <i>pence</i>, but of <i>dollars</i> and
<i>cents</i>. In brief, a gallant attempt upon a strange tongue, and
by a writer of the utmost skill—but a hopeless failure none the
less. In the midst of his best American, George drops into
Briticism after Briticism, some of them quite as unintelligible
to the average American reader as so many Gallicisms. On
page after page they display the practical impossibility of the
enterprise: <i>back-garden</i> for <i>back-yard</i>, <i>perambulator</i> for <i>baby-carriage</i>,
<i>corn</i>-market for <i>grain</i>-market, coal-<i>owner</i> for coal-<i>operator</i>,
<i>post</i> for <i>mail</i>, and so on. And to top them there are
English terms that have no American equivalents at all, for
example, <i>kitchen-fender</i>.</p>

<p>The same failure, perhaps usually worse, is displayed every
time an English novelist or dramatist essays to put an American
into a novel or a play, and to make him speak American. However
painstakingly it is done, the Englishman invariably falls
into capital blunders, and the result is derided by Americans
as Mark Twain derided the miners' lingo of Bret Harte, and for
the same reason. The thing lies deeper than vocabulary and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg140"></a>[Pg140]</span>
even than pronunciation and intonation; the divergences show
themselves in habits of speech that are fundamental and almost
indefinable. And when the transoceanic gesture is from the
other direction they become even plainer. An Englishman, in
an American play, seldom shows the actual speech habit of the
Sassenach; what he shows is the speech habit of an American
actor trying to imitate George Alexander. "There are not five
playwrights in America," said Channing Pollock one day, "who
can write English"—that is, the English of familiar discourse.
"Why should there be?" replied Louis Sherwin. "There are
not five thousand people in America who can <i>speak</i> English."<a name="FNanchor_12_211" id="FNanchor_12_211"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_211" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The elements that enter into the special character of American
have been rehearsed in the first chapter: a general impatience of
rule and restraint, a democratic enmity to all authority, an extravagant
and often grotesque humor, an extraordinary capacity
for metaphor<a name="FNanchor_13_212" id="FNanchor_13_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_212" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>—in brief, all the natural marks of what Van
Wyck Brooks calls "a popular life which bubbles with energy
and spreads and grows and slips away ever more and more from
the control of tested ideas, a popular life with the lid off."<a name="FNanchor_14_213" id="FNanchor_14_213"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_213" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
This is the spirit of America, and from it the American language
is nourished. Brooks, perhaps, generalizes a bit too lavishly.
Below the surface there is also a curious conservatism, even a
sort of timorousness; in a land of manumitted peasants the primary
trait of the peasant is bound to show itself now and then;
as Wendell Phillips once said, "more than any other people, we
Americans are afraid of one another"—that is, afraid of opposition,
of derision, of all the consequences of singularity. But in
the field of language, as in that of politics, this suspicion of the
new is often transformed into a suspicion of the merely unfamiliar,
and so its natural tendency toward conservatism is overcome.
It is of the essence of democracy that it remain a government
by amateurs, and under a government by amateurs it is
precisely the expert who is most questioned—and it is the expert <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg141"></a>[Pg141]</span>
who commonly stresses the experience of the past. And in a
democratic society it is not the iconoclast who seems most revolutionary,
but the purist. The derisive designation of <i>high-brow</i>
is thoroughly American in more ways than one. It is a word
put together in an unmistakably American fashion, it reflects an
habitual American attitude of mind, and its potency in debate
is peculiarly national too.</p>

<p>I daresay it is largely a fear of the weapon in it—and there are
many others of like effect in the arsenal—which accounts for the
far greater prevalence of idioms from below in the formal speech
of America than in the formal speech of England. There is
surely no English novelist of equal rank whose prose shows so
much of colloquial looseness and ease as one finds in the prose of
Howells: to find a match for it one must go to the prose of the
neo-Celts, professedly modelled upon the speech of peasants, and
almost proudly defiant of English grammar and syntax, and to
the prose of the English themselves before the Restoration. Nor
is it imaginable that an Englishman of comparable education and
position would ever employ such locutions as those I have hitherto
quoted from the public addresses of Dr. Wilson—that is,
innocently, seriously, as a matter of course. The Englishman,
when he makes use of coinages of that sort, does so in conscious
relaxation, and usually with a somewhat heavy sense of doggishness.
They are proper to the paddock or even to the dinner
table, but scarcely to serious scenes and occasions. But in the
United States their use is the rule rather than the exception; it is
not the man who uses them, but the man who doesn't use them,
who is marked off. Their employment, if high example counts
for anything, is a standard habit of the language, as their diligent
avoidance is a standard habit of English.</p>

<p>A glance through the <cite>Congressional Record</cite> is sufficient to show
how small is the minority of purists among the chosen leaders of
the nation. Within half an hour, turning the pages at random,
I find scores of locutions that would paralyze the stenographers
in the House of Commons, and they are in the speeches, not of
wild mavericks from the West, but of some of the chief men of
the two Houses. Surely no Senator occupied a more conspicuous <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg142"></a>[Pg142]</span>
position, during the first year of the war, than Lee S. Overman,
of North Carolina, chairman of the Committee on Rules, and
commander of the administration forces on the floor. Well, I
find Senator Overman using <i>to enthuse</i> in a speech of the utmost
seriousness and importance, and not once, but over and over
again.<a name="FNanchor_15_214" id="FNanchor_15_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_214" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I turn back a few pages and encounter it again—this
time in the mouth of General Sherwood, of Ohio. A few more,
and I find a fit match for it, to wit, <i>to biograph</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_215" id="FNanchor_16_215"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_215" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The speaker
here is Senator L. Y. Sherman, of Illinois. In the same speech
he uses <i>to resolute</i>. A few more, and various other characteristic
verbs are unearthed: <i>to demagogue</i>,<a name="FNanchor_17_216" id="FNanchor_17_216"></a><a

nouns, chiefly compounds, all pressing upward for recognition:
<i>tin-Lizzie</i>, <i>brain-storm</i>, <i>come-down</i>, <i>pin-head</i>, <i>trustification</i>, <i>pork-barrel</i>,
<i>buck-private</i>, <i>dough-boy</i>, <i>cow-country</i>. And adjectives:

And phrases: <i>dollars to doughnuts</i>, <i>on the job</i>, <i>that gets
me</i>, <i>one best bet</i>. And back-formations: <i>ad</i>, <i>movie</i>, <i>photo</i>. And <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg143"></a>[Pg143]</span>
various substitutions and Americanized inflections: <i>over</i> for <i>more

href="#Footnote_27_226" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> <i>rile</i> for <i>roil</i>, <i>bust</i> for
<i>burst</i>. This last, in truth, has come into a dignity that even
grammarians will soon hesitate to question. Who, in America,
would dare to speak of <i>bursting</i> a broncho, or of a <i>trust-burster</i>?<a name="FNanchor_28_227" id="FNanchor_28_227"></a><a

<p class="ph3number">§ 3</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Lost_Distinctions"></a>Lost Distinctions</h3>—This general iconoclasm reveals itself especially
in a disdain for most of the niceties of modern English.
The American, like the Elizabethan Englishman, is usually quite
unconscious of them and even when they have been instilled into
him by the hard labor of pedagogues he commonly pays little
heed to them in his ordinary discourse. The English distinction
between <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i> offers a salient case in point. This distinction,
it may be said at once, is far more a confection of the
grammarians than a product of the natural forces shaping the
language. It has, indeed, little etymological basis, and is but
imperfectly justified logically. One finds it disregarded in the
Authorized Version of the Bible, in all the plays of Shakespeare,
in the essays of the reign of Anne, and in some of the best examples
of modern English literature. The theory behind it is so
inordinately abstruse that the Fowlers, in "The King's English,"<a name="FNanchor_29_228" id="FNanchor_29_228"></a><a
href="#Footnote_29_228" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
require 20 pages to explain it, and even then they come
to the resigned conclusion that the task is hopeless. "The idiomatic
use [of the two auxiliaries]," they say, "is so complicated
that those who are not to the manner born can hardly acquire
it."<a name="FNanchor_30_229" id="FNanchor_30_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_229" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Well, even those who are to the manner born seem to find <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg144"></a>[Pg144]</span>
it difficult, for at once the learned authors cite blunder in the
writings of Richardson, Stevenson, Gladstone, Jowett, Oscar
Wilde, and even Henry Sweet, author of the best existing grammar
of the English language. In American the distinction is
almost lost. No ordinary American, save after the most laborious
reflection, would detect anything wrong in this sentence from
the <cite>London Times</cite>, denounced as corrupt by the Fowlers: "We
must reconcile what we would like to do with what we can do."
Nor in this by W. B. Yeats: "The character who delights us
may commit murder like Macbeth ... and yet we will rejoice
in every happiness that comes to him." Half a century ago,
impatient of the effort to fasten the English distinction upon
American, George P. Marsh attacked it as of "no logical value or
significance whatever," and predicted that "at no very distant
day this verbal quibble will disappear, and one of the auxiliaries
will be employed, with all persons of the nominative, exclusively
as the sign of the future, and the other only as an expression of
purpose or authority."<a name="FNanchor_31_230" id="FNanchor_31_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_230" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This prophecy has been substantially
verified. <i>Will</i> is sound American "with all persons of the nominative,"
and <i>shall</i> is almost invariably an "expression of purpose
or authority."<a name="FNanchor_32_231" id="FNanchor_32_231"></a><a
href="#Footnote_32_231" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></div>

<p>And so, though perhaps not to the same extent, with <i>who</i> and
<i>whom</i>. Now and then there arises a sort of panicky feeling that
<i>whom</i> is being neglected, and so it is trotted out,<a name="FNanchor_33_232" id="FNanchor_33_232"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_232" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but in the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg145"></a>[Pg145]</span>
main the American language tends to dispense with it, at least
in its least graceful situations. Noah Webster, always the pragmatic
reformer, denounced it so long ago as 1783. Common
sense, he argued, was on the side of "<i>who</i> did he marry?" Today
such a form as "<i>whom</i> are you talking to?" would seem
somewhat affected in ordinary discourse in America; "<i>who</i> are
you talking to?" is heard a thousand times oftener—and is
doubly American, for it substitutes <i>who</i> for <i>whom</i> and puts a
preposition at the end of a sentence: two crimes that most English
purists would seek to avoid. It is among the pronouns that the
only remaining case inflections in English are to be found, if we
forget the possessive, and even here these survivors of an earlier
day begin to grow insecure. Lounsbury's defense of "it is
<i>me</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_34_233" id="FNanchor_34_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_233" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as we shall see in the next chapter, has support in the
history and natural movement of the language, and that movement
is also against the preservation of the distinction between
<i>who</i> and <i>whom</i>. The common speech plays hob with both of the
orthodox inflections, despite the protests of grammarians, and in
the long run, no doubt, they will be forced to yield to its pressure,
as they have always yielded in the past. Between the dative and
accusative on the one side and the nominative on the other there
has been war in the English language for centuries, and it has
always tended to become a war of extermination. Our now universal
use of <i>you</i> for <i>ye</i> in the nominative shows the dative and
accusative swallowing the nominative, and the practical disappearance
of <i>hither</i>, <i>thither</i> and <i>whither</i>, whose place is now taken
by <i>here</i>, <i>there</i> and <i>where</i>, shows a contrary process. In such
wars a <i>posse comitatus</i> marches ahead of the disciplined army.
American stands to English in the relation of that posse to that
army. It is incomparably more enterprising, more contemptuous
of precedent and authority, more impatient of rule.</p>

<p>A shadowy line often separates what is currently coming into
sound usage from what is still regarded as barbarous. No self-respecting
American, I daresay, would defend <i>ain't</i> as a substitute <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg146"></a>[Pg146]</span>
for <i>isn't</i>, say in "he <i>ain't</i> the man," and yet <i>ain't</i> is already
tolerably respectable in the first person, where English countenances
the even more clumsy <i>aren't</i>. <i>Aren't</i> has never got a
foothold in the American first person; when it is used at all,
which is very rarely, it is always as a conscious Briticism.
Facing the alternative of employing the unwieldy "am I not in
this?" the American turns boldly to "<i>ain't</i> I in this?" It still
grates a bit, perhaps, but <i>aren't</i> grates even more. Here, as always,
the popular speech is pulling the exacter speech along, and
no one familiar with its successes in the past can have much doubt
that it will succeed again, soon or late. In the same way it is
breaking down the inflectional distinction between adverb and
adjective, so that "I feel <i>bad</i>" begins to take on the dignity of
a national idiom, and <i>sure</i>, <i>to go big</i> and <i>run slow</i><a name="FNanchor_35_234" id="FNanchor_35_234"></a><a
href="#Footnote_35_234" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> become almost
respectable. When, on the entrance of the United States
into the war, the Marine Corps chose "treat 'em <i>rough</i>" as its
motto, no one thought to raise a grammatical objection, and the
clipped adverb was printed upon hundreds of thousands of posters
and displayed in every town in the country, always with
the imprimatur of the national government. So, again, American,
in its spoken form, tends to obliterate the distinction between
nearly related adjectives, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>healthful</i> and <i>healthy</i>,
<i>tasteful</i> and <i>tasty</i>. And to challenge the somewhat absurd text-book
prohibition of terminal prepositions, so that "where are we
<i>at</i>?" loses its old raciness. And to dally with the double negative,
as in "I have no doubt <i>but</i> that."<a name="FNanchor_36_235" id="FNanchor_36_235"></a><a
href="#Footnote_36_235" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>But these tendencies, or at least the more extravagant of them,
belong to the next chapter. How much influence they exert, even <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg147"></a>[Pg147]</span>
indirectly, is shown by the American disdain of the English precision
in the use of the indefinite pronoun. I turn to the <cite>Saturday
Evening Post</cite>, and in two minutes find: "<i>one</i> feels like an
atom when <i>he</i> begins to review <i>his</i> own life and deeds."<a name="FNanchor_37_236" id="FNanchor_37_236"></a><a
href="#Footnote_37_236" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The
error is very rare in English; the Fowlers, seeking examples of
it, could get them only from the writings of a third-rate woman
novelist, Scotch to boot. But it is so common in American that
it scarcely attracts notice. Neither does the appearance of a redundant
<i>s</i> in such words as <i>towards</i>, <i>downwards</i>, <i>afterwards</i> and
<i>heavenwards</i>. In England this <i>s</i> is used relatively seldom, and
then it usually marks a distinction in meaning, as it does on both
sides of the ocean between <i>beside</i> and <i>besides</i>. "In modern
standard English," says Smith,<a name="FNanchor_38_237" id="FNanchor_38_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_237" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> "though not in the English of
the United States, a distinction which we feel, but many of us
could not define, is made between <i>forward</i> and <i>forwards</i>; <i>forwards</i>
being used in definite contrast to any other direction, as
'if you move at all, you can only move <i>forwards</i>,' while <i>forward</i>
is used where no such contrast is implied, as in the common
phrase 'to bring a matter forward.'"<a name="FNanchor_39_238" id="FNanchor_39_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_238" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This specific distinction,
despite Smith, probably retains some force in the United
States too, but in general our usage allows the <i>s</i> in cases where
English usage would certainly be against it. Gould, in the 50's,
noted its appearance at the end of such words as <i>somewhere</i> and
<i>anyway</i>, and denounced it as vulgar and illogical. Thornton has
traced <i>anyways</i> back to 1842 and shown that it is an archaism,
and to be found in the Book of Common Prayer (<i class="abblatin">circa</i> 1560);
perhaps it has been preserved by analogy with <i>sideways</i>. Henry
James, in "The Question of Our Speech," attacked "such forms
of impunity as <i>somewheres else</i> and <i>nowheres else</i>, <i>a good ways
on</i> and <i>a good ways off</i>" as "vulgarisms with what a great deal
of general credit for what we good-naturedly call 'refinement'
appears so able to coexist."<a name="FNanchor_40_239" id="FNanchor_40_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_239" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i>Towards</i> and <i>afterwards</i>, though
frowned upon in England, are now quite sound in American. I <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg148"></a>[Pg148]</span>
find the former in the title of an article in <cite>Dialect Notes</cite>, which
plainly gives it scholastic authority.<a name="FNanchor_41_240" id="FNanchor_41_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_240" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> More (and with no little
humor), I find it in the deed of a fund given to the American
Academy of Arts and Letters to enable the gifted philologs of
that sanhedrin "to consider its duty <i>towards</i> the conservation of
the English language in its beauty and purity."<a name="FNanchor_42_241" id="FNanchor_42_241"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42_241" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Both <i>towards</i>
and <i>afterwards</i>, finally, are included in the <cite>New York
Evening Post's</cite> list of "words no longer disapproved when in
their proper places," along with <i>over</i> for <i>more than</i>, and <i>during</i>
for <i>in the course of</i>.</p>

<p>In the last chapter we glanced at several salient differences
between the common coin of English and the common coin of
American—that is, the verbs and adjectives in constant colloquial
use—the rubber-stamps, so to speak, of the two languages.
America has two adverbs that belong to the same category.
They are <i>right</i> and <i>good</i>. Neither holds the same place in English.
Thornton shows that the use of <i>right</i>, as in <i>right away</i>,
<i>right good</i> and <i>right now</i>, was already widespread in the United
States early in the last century; his first example is dated 1818.
He believes that the locution was "possibly imported from the
southwest of Ireland." Whatever its origin, it quickly attracted
the attention of English visitors. Dickens noted <i>right away</i> as
an almost universal Americanism during his first American tour,
in 1842, and poked fun at it in the second chapter of "American
Notes." <i>Right</i> is used as a synonym for <i>directly</i>, as in <i>right
away</i>, <i>right off</i>, <i>right now</i> and <i>right on time</i>; for <i>moderately</i>, as
in <i>right well</i>, <i>right smart</i>, <i>right good</i> and <i>right often</i>, and in
place of <i>precisely</i>, as in <i>right there</i>. Some time ago, in an article
on Americanisms, an English critic called it "that most distinctively
American word," and concocted the following dialogue to
instruct the English in its use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>How do I get to——?</div>

<div>Go <i>right</i> along, and take the first turning
(<i class="abblatin">sic</i>) on the <i>right</i>, and
you are <i>right</i> there.</div>

<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg149"></a><span class="hidden">[Pg149]</span></span>

<div><i>Right?</i></div>

<div><i>Right.</i></div>

<div><i>Right!</i><a name="FNanchor_43_242" id="FNanchor_43_242"></a><a
href="#Footnote_43_242" class="fnanchor"> [43]</a></div></div>

<p>Like W. L. George, this Englishman failed in his attempt to
write correct American despite his fine pedagogical passion. No
American would ever say "take the first turning"; he would say
"turn at the first corner." As for <i>right away</i>, R. O. Williams
argues that "so far as analogy can make good English, it is as
good as one could choose."<a name="FNanchor_44_243" id="FNanchor_44_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_243" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Nevertheless, the Oxford Dictionary
admits it only as an Americanism, and avoids all mention of
the other American uses of <i>right</i> as an adverb. <i>Good</i> is almost
as protean. It is not only used as a general synonym for all
adjectives and adverbs connoting satisfaction, as in <i>to feel good</i>,
<i>to be treated good</i>, <i>to sleep good</i>, but also as a reinforcement to
other adjectives and adverbs, as in "I hit him <i>good</i> and hard"
and "I am <i>good</i> and tired." Of late <i>some</i> has come into wide
use as an adjective-adverb of all work, indicating special excellence
or high degree, as in <i>some girl</i>, <i>some sick</i>, <i>going some</i>, etc.
It is still below the salt, but threatens to reach a more respectable
position. One encounters it in the newspapers constantly and
in the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>, and not long ago a writer in the
<cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite><a name="FNanchor_45_244" id="FNanchor_45_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_244" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> hymned it ecstatically as "<i>some</i> word—a true
super-word, in fact" and argued that it could be used "in a sense
for which there is absolutely no synonym in the dictionary."
Basically, it appears to be an adjective, but in many of its common
situations the grammarians would probably call it an adverb.
It gives no little support to the growing tendency, already noticed,
to break down the barrier between the two parts of speech.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 4</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Foreign_Influences_Today"></a>Foreign Influences Today</h3>—No other great nation of today
supports so large a foreign population as the United States, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg150"></a>[Pg150]</span>
either relatively or absolutely; none other contains so many foreigners
forced to an effort, often ignorant and ineffective, to
master the national language. Since 1820 nearly 35,000,000
immigrants have come into the country, and of them probably
not 10,000,000 brought any preliminary acquaintance with English
with them. The census of 1910 showed that nearly 1,500,000
persons then living permanently on American soil could not
speak it at all; that more than 13,000,000 had been born in other
countries, chiefly of different language; and that nearly 20,000,000
were the children of such immigrants, and hence under the
influence of their speech habits. Altogether, there were probably
at least 25,000,000 whose house language was not the vulgate,
and who thus spoke it in competition with some other language.
No other country houses so many aliens. In Great Britain
the alien population, for a century past, has never been more
than 2 per cent of the total population, and since the passage
of the Alien Act of 1905 it has tended to decline steadily. In
Germany, in 1910, there were but 1,259,873 aliens in a population
of more than 60,000,000, and of these nearly a half were
German-speaking Austrians and Swiss. In France, in 1906,
there were 1,000,000 foreigners in a population of 39,000,000 and
a third of them were French-speaking Belgians, Luxembourgeois
and Swiss. In Italy, in 1911, there were but 350,000 in a population
of 35,000,000.</div>

<p>This large and constantly reinforced admixture of foreigners
has naturally exerted a constant pressure upon the national language,
for the majority of them, at least in the first generation,
have found it quite impossible to acquire it in any purity, and
even their children have grown up with speech habits differing
radically from those of correct English. The effects of this pressure
are obviously two-fold; on the one hand the foreigner, struggling
with a strange and difficult tongue, makes efforts to simplify
it as much as possible, and so strengthens the native tendency
to disregard all niceties and complexities, and on the other
hand he corrupts it with words and locutions from the language
he has brought with him, and sometimes with whole idioms and
grammatical forms. We have seen, in earlier chapters, how the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg151"></a>[Pg151]</span>
Dutch and French of colonial days enriched the vocabulary of
the colonists, how the German immigrants of the first half of the
nineteenth century enriched it still further, and how the Irish of
the same period influenced its everyday usages. The same process
is still going on. The Italians, the Slavs, and, above all, the
Russian Jews, make steady contributions to the American vocabulary
and idiom, and though these contributions are often concealed
by quick and complete naturalization their foreignness to
English remains none the less obvious. <i>I should worry</i>,<a name="FNanchor_46_245" id="FNanchor_46_245"></a><a
href="#Footnote_46_245" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in its
way, is correct English, but in essence it is as completely Yiddish
as <i>kosher</i>, <i>ganof</i>, <i>schadchen</i>, <i>oi-yoi</i>, <i>matzoh</i> or <i>mazuma</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_246" id="FNanchor_47_246"></a><a
href="#Footnote_47_246" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
<i>Black-hand</i>, too, is English in form, but it is nevertheless as
plainly an Italian loan-word as <i>spaghetti</i>, <i>mafia</i> or <i>padrone</i>.</p>

<p>The extent of such influences upon American, and particularly
upon spoken American, remains to be studied; in the whole literature
I can find but one formal article upon the subject. That
article<a name="FNanchor_48_247" id="FNanchor_48_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_247" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> deals specifically with the suffix <i>-fest</i>, which came into
American from the German and was probably suggested by familiarity
with <i>sängerfest</i>. There is no mention of it in any of
the dictionaries of Americanisms, and yet, in such forms as <i>talk-fest</i>
and <i>gabfest</i> it is met with almost daily. So with <i>-heimer</i>,
<i>-inski</i> and <i>-bund</i>. Several years ago <i>-heimer</i> had a great vogue
in slang, and was rapidly done to death. But <i>wiseheimer</i> remains <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg152"></a>[Pg152]</span>
in colloquial use as a facetious synonym for <i>smart-aleck</i>,
and after awhile it may gradually acquire dignity. Far lowlier
words, in fact, have worked their way in. <i>Buttinski</i>, perhaps, is
going the same route. As for the words in <i>-bund</i>, many of them
are already almost accepted. <i>Plunder-bund</i> is now at least as
good as <i>pork-barrel</i> and <i>slush-fund</i>, and <i>money-bund</i> is frequently
heard in Congress.<a name="FNanchor_49_248" id="FNanchor_49_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_248" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Such locutions creep in stealthily, and are
secure before they are suspected. Current slang, out of which
the more decorous language dredges a large part of its raw materials,
is full of them. <i>Nix</i> and <i>nixy</i>, for <i>no</i>, are debased forms
of the German <i>nichts</i>; <i>aber nit</i>, once as popular as <i>camouflage</i>, is
obviously <i>aber nicht</i>. And a steady flow of nouns, all needed to
designate objects introduced by immigrants, enriches the vocabulary.
The Hungarians not only brought their national condiment
with them; they also brought its name, <i>paprika</i>, and that
name is now thoroughly American.<a name="FNanchor_50_249" id="FNanchor_50_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_249" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In the same way the Italians
brought in <i>camorra</i>, <i>padrone</i>, <i>spaghetti</i> and a score of other
substantives, and the Jews made contributions from Yiddish and
Hebrew and greatly reinforced certain old borrowings from German.
Once such a loan-word gets in it takes firm root. During
the first year of American participation in the World War an
effort was made, on patriotic grounds, to substitute <i>liberty-cabbage</i>
for <i>sour-kraut</i>, but it quickly failed, for the name had become
as completely Americanized as the thing itself, and so
<i>liberty-cabbage</i> seemed affected and absurd. In the same way
a great many other German words survived the passions of the
time. Nor could all the influence of the professional patriots
obliterate that German influence which has fastened upon the
American <i>yes</i> something of the quality of <i>ja</i>.</p>

<p>Constant familiarity with such contributions from foreign languages
and with the general speech habits of foreign peoples has
made American a good deal more hospitable to loan-words than
English, even in the absence of special pressure. Let the same <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg153"></a>[Pg153]</span>
word knock at the gates of the two languages, and American will
admit it more readily, and give it at once a wider and more intimate
currency. Examples are afforded by <i>café</i>, <i>vaudeville</i>, <i>employé</i>,
<i>boulevard</i>, <i>cabaret</i>, <i>toilette</i>, <i>exposé</i>, <i>kindergarten</i>, <i>dépôt</i>,
<i>fête</i> and <i>menu</i>. <i>Café</i>, in American, is a word of much larger and
more varied meaning than in English and is used much more
frequently, and by many more persons. So is <i>employé</i>, in the
naturalized form of <i>employee</i>. So is <i>toilet</i>: we have even seen it
as a euphemism for native terms that otherwise would be in daily
use. So is <i>kindergarten</i>: I read lately of a <i>kindergarten</i> for the
elementary instruction of conscripts. Such words are not unknown
to the Englishman, but when he uses them it is with a
plain sense of their foreignness. In American they are completely
naturalized, as is shown by the spelling and pronunciation
of most of them. An American would no more think of
attempting the French pronunciation of <i>depot</i> or of putting the
French accents upon it than he would think of spelling <i>toilet</i>
with the final <i>te</i> or of essaying to pronounce <i>Anheuser</i> in the
German manner. Often curious battles go on between such loan-words
and their English equivalents, and with varying fortunes.
In 1895 Weber and Fields tried to establish <i>music-hall</i> in New
York, but it quickly succumbed to <i>vaudeville-theatre</i>, as <i>variety</i>
had succumbed to <i>vaudeville</i> before it. In the same way <i>lawn-fete</i>
(without the circumflex accent, and commonly pronounced
<i>feet</i>) has elbowed out the English <i>garden-party</i>. But now and
then, when the competing loan-word happens to violate American
speech habits, a native term ousts it. The French <i>crèche</i> offers
an example; it has been entirely displaced by <i>day-nursery</i>.</p>

<p>The English, in this matter, display their greater conservatism
very plainly. Even when a loan-word enters both English and
American simultaneously a sense of foreignness lingers about it
on the other side of the Atlantic much longer than on this side,
and it is used with far more self-consciousness. The word
<i>matinée</i> offers a convenient example. To this day the English
commonly print it in italics, give it its French accent, and pronounce
it with some attempt at the French manner. But in
America it is entirely naturalized, and the most ignorant man <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg154"></a>[Pg154]</span>
uses it without any feeling that it is strange. The same lack of
any sense of linguistic integrity is to be noticed in many other
directions—for example, in the freedom with which the Latin <i>per</i>
is used with native nouns. One constantly sees <i>per day</i>, <i>per
dozen</i>, <i>per hundred</i>, <i>per mile</i>, etc., in American newspapers, even
the most careful, but in England the more seemly <i>a</i> is almost
always used, or the noun itself is made Latin, as in <i>per diem</i>.
<i>Per</i>, in fact, is fast becoming an everyday American word. Such
phrases as "as <i>per</i> your letter (or order) of the 15th inst." are
incessantly met with in business correspondence. The same
greater hospitality is shown by the readiness with which various
un-English prefixes and affixes come into fashion, for example,
<i>super-</i> and <i>-itis</i>. The English accept them gingerly; the Americans
take them in with enthusiasm, and naturalize them instanter.<a name="FNanchor_51_250" id="FNanchor_51_250"></a><a
href="#Footnote_51_250" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The same deficiency in reserve is to be noted in nearly all other
colonialized dialects. The Latin-American variants of Spanish,
for example, have adopted a great many words which appear in
true Castilian only as occasional guests. Thus in Argentina
<i>matinée</i>, <i>menu</i>, <i>début</i>, <i>toilette</i> and <i>femme de chambre</i> are perfectly
good Argentine, and in Mexico <i>sandwich</i> and <i>club</i> have
been thoroughly naturalized. The same thing is to be noted in
the French of Haiti, in the Portuguese of Brazil, and even in the
Danish of Norway. Once a language spreads beyond the country
of its origin and begins to be used by people born, in the German
phrase, to a different <i>Sprachgefühl</i>, the sense of loyalty to its
vocabulary is lost, along with the instinctive feeling for its idiomatic
habits. How far this destruction of its forms may go in
the absence of strong contrary influences is exhibited by the rise
of the Romance languages from the vulgar Latin of the Roman
provinces, and, here at home, by the decay of foreign languages
in competition with English. The Yiddish that the Jews from
Russia bring in is German debased with Russian, Polish and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg155"></a>[Pg155]</span>
Hebrew; in America, it quickly absorbs hundreds of words and
idioms from the speech of the streets. Various conflicting German
dialects, among the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch and in the
German areas of the Northwest, combine in a patois that, in its
end forms, shows almost as much English as German. Classical
examples of it are "es giebt gar kein <i>use</i>," "Ich kann es nicht
<i>ständen</i>" and "mein <i>stallion</i> hat über die <i>fenz gescheumpt</i> und
dem nachbar sein <i>whiet</i> abscheulich <i>gedämätscht</i>."<a name="FNanchor_52_251" id="FNanchor_52_251"></a><a
href="#Footnote_52_251" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The use of
<i>gleiche</i> for <i>to like</i>, by false analogy from <i>gleich</i> (=<i>like</i>, <i>similar</i>)
is characteristic. In the same way the Scandinavians in the
Northwest corrupt their native Swedish and Dano-Norwegian.
Thus, American-Norwegian is heavy with such forms as <i>strit-kar</i>,
<i>reit-evé</i>, <i>nekk-töi</i> and <i>staits-pruessen</i>, for <i>street-car</i>, <i>right away</i>,
<i>necktie</i> and <i>states-prison</i>, and admits such phrases as "det <i>meka</i>
ingen <i>difrens</i>."<a name="FNanchor_53_252" id="FNanchor_53_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_252" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The changes that Yiddish has undergone in America, though
rather foreign to the present inquiry, are interesting enough to
be noticed. First of all, it has admitted into its vocabulary a
large number of everyday substantives, among them <i>boy</i>, <i>chair</i>,
<i>window</i>, <i>carpet</i>, <i>floor</i>, <i>dress</i>, <i>hat</i>, <i>watch</i>, <i>ceiling</i>, <i>consumption</i>,
<i>property</i>, <i>trouble</i>, <i>bother</i>, <i>match</i>, <i>change</i>, <i>party</i>, <i>birthday</i>, <i>picture</i>,
<i>paper</i> (only in the sense of <i>newspaper</i>), <i>gambler</i>, <i>show</i>, <i>hall</i>,
<i>kitchen</i>, <i>store</i>, <i>bedroom</i>, <i>key</i>, <i>mantelpiece</i>, <i>closet</i>, <i>lounge</i>, <i>broom</i>,
<i>tablecloth</i>, <i>paint</i>, <i>landlord</i>, <i>fellow</i>, <i>tenant</i>, <i>shop</i>, <i>wages</i>, <i>foreman</i>,
<i>sleeve</i>, <i>collar</i>, <i>cuff</i>, <i>button</i>, <i>cotton</i>, <i>thimble</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>pocket</i>, <i>bargain</i>,
<i>sale</i>, <i>remnant</i>, <i>sample</i>, <i>haircut</i>, <i>razor</i>, <i>waist</i>, <i>basket</i>, <i>school</i>,
<i>scholar</i>, <i>teacher</i>, <i>baby</i>, <i>mustache</i>, <i>butcher</i>, <i>grocery</i>, <i>dinner</i>, <i>street</i>
and <i>walk</i>. And with them many characteristic Americanisms, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg156"></a>[Pg156]</span>
for example, <i>bluffer</i>, <i>faker</i>, <i>boodler</i>, <i>grafter</i>, <i>gangster</i>, <i>crook</i>, <i>guy</i>,
<i>kike</i>, <i>piker</i>, <i>squealer</i>, <i>bum</i>, <i>cadet</i>, <i>boom</i>, <i>bunch</i>, <i>pants</i>, <i>vest</i>, <i>loafer</i>,
<i>jumper</i>, <i>stoop</i>, <i>saleslady</i>, <i>ice-box</i> and <i>raise</i>, with their attendant
verbs and adjectives. These words are used constantly; many of
them have quite crowded out the corresponding Yiddish words.
For example, <i>ingel</i>, meaning <i>boy</i> (it is a Slavic loan-word in Yiddish),
has been obliterated by the English word. A Jewish immigrant
almost invariably refers to his son as his <i>boy</i>, though
strangely enough he calls his daughter his <i>meidel</i>. "Die <i>boys</i> mit
die <i>meidlach</i> haben a good time" is excellent American Yiddish.
In the same way <i>fenster</i> has been completely displaced by <i>window</i>,
though <i>tür</i> (=<i>door</i>) has been left intact. <i>Tisch</i> (=<i>table</i>)
also remains, but <i>chair</i> is always used, probably because few of
the Jews had chairs in the old country. There the <i>beinkel</i>, a
bench without a back, was in use; chairs were only for the well-to-do.
<i>Floor</i> has apparently prevailed because no invariable corresponding
word was employed at home: in various parts of Russia
and Poland a floor is a <i>dill</i>, a <i>podlogé</i>, or a <i>bricke</i>. So with
<i>ceiling</i>. There were six different words for it.</p>

<p>Yiddish inflections have been fastened upon most of these loan-words.
Thus, "er hat ihm <i>abgefaked</i>" is "he cheated him," <i>zubumt</i>
is the American <i>gone to the bad</i>, <i>fix'n</i> is to <i>fix</i>, <i>usen</i> is <i>to
use</i>, and so on. The feminine and diminutive suffix <i>-ké</i> is often
added to nouns. Thus <i>bluffer</i> gives rise to <i>blufferké</i> (=<i>hypocrite</i>),
and one also notes <i>dresské</i>, <i>hatké</i>, <i>watchké</i> and <i>bummerké</i>.
"Oi! is sie a <i>blufferké</i>!" is good American Yiddish for "isn't
she a hypocrite!" The suffix <i>-nick</i>, signifying agency, is also
freely applied. <i>Allrightnick</i> means an upstart, an offensive
boaster, one of whom his fellows would say "He is all right"
with a sneer. Similarly, <i>consumptionick</i> means a victim of tuberculosis.
Other suffixes are <i>-chick</i> and <i>-ige</i>, the first exemplified
in <i>boychick</i>, a diminutive of <i>boy</i>, and the second in <i>next-doorige</i>,
meaning the woman next-door, an important person in ghetto
social life. Some of the loan-words, of course, undergo changes
on Yiddish-speaking lips. Thus, <i>landlord</i> becomes <i>lendler</i>,
<i>lounge</i> becomes <i>lunch</i>, <i>tenant</i> becomes <i>tenner</i>, and <i>whiskers</i> loses
its final <i>s</i>. "Wie gefällt dir sein <i>whisker</i>?" (=how do you like
his beard?) <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg157"></a>[Pg157]</span> is good Yiddish, ironically intended. <i>Fellow</i>, of
course, changes to the American <i>feller</i>, as in "Rosie hat schon a
<i>feller</i>" (=Rosie has got a <i>feller</i>, <i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, a sweetheart). <i>Show</i>, in
the sense of <i>chance</i>, is used constantly, as in "git ihm a <i>show</i>"
(=give him a chance). <i>Bad boy</i> is adopted bodily, as in "er is
a <i>bad boy</i>." To <i>shut up</i> is inflected as one word, as in "er hat
nit gewolt <i>shutup'n</i>" (=he wouldn't shut up). <i>To catch</i> is used
in the sense of to obtain, as in "<i>catch'n</i> a gmilath chesed" (=to
raise a loan). Here, by the way, <i>gmilath chesed</i> is excellent
Biblical Hebrew. <i>To bluff</i>, unchanged in form, takes on the new
meaning of to lie: a <i>bluffer</i> is a liar. Scores of American phrases
are in constant use, among them, <i>all right</i>, <i>never mind</i>, <i>I bet you</i>,
<i>no sir</i> and <i>I'll fix you</i>. It is curious to note that <i>sure Mike</i>, borrowed
by the American vulgate from Irish English, has gone over
into American Yiddish. Finally, to make an end, here are two
complete and characteristic American Yiddish sentences: "Sie
wet <i>clean'n</i> die <i>rooms</i>, <i>scrub'n</i> dem <i>floor</i>, <i>wash'n</i> die <i>windows</i>,
<i>dress'n</i> dem <i>boy</i> und gehn in <i>butcher-store</i> und in <i>grocery</i>. Dernoch
vet sie machen <i>dinner</i> und gehn in <i>street</i> für a <i>walk</i>."<a name="FNanchor_54_253" id="FNanchor_54_253"></a><a
href="#Footnote_54_253" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>American itself, in the Philippines, and to a lesser extent in
Porto Rico and on the Isthmus, has undergone similar changes
under the influence of Spanish and the native dialects. Maurice
P. Dunlap<a name="FNanchor_55_254" id="FNanchor_55_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_254" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> offers the following specimen of a conversation between
two Americans long resident in Manila:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>Hola, amigo.</div>

<div>Komusta kayo.</div>

<div>Porque were you hablaing with ese señorita?</div>

<div>She wanted a job as lavandera.</div>

<div>Cuanto?</div>

<div>Ten cents, conant, a piece, so I told her no kerry.</div>

<div>Have you had chow? Well, spera till I sign this chit and I'll take
a paseo with you.</div></div>

<p><span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg158"></a>[Pg158]</span></p>

<p>Here we have an example of Philippine American that shows
all the tendencies of American Yiddish. It retains the general
forms of American, but in the short conversation, embracing but
41 different words, there are eight loan-words from the Spanish
(<i>hola</i>, <i>amigo</i>, <i>porque</i>, <i>ese</i>, <i>señorita</i>, <i>lavandera</i>, <i>cuanto</i> and <i>paseo</i>),
two Spanish locutions in a debased form (<i>spera</i> for <i>espera</i> and
<i>no kerry</i> for <i>no quiro</i>), two loan-words from the Taglog (<i>komusta</i>
and <i>kayo</i>), two from Pigeon English (<i>chow</i> and <i>chit</i>), one Philippine-American
localism (<i>conant</i>), and a Spanish verb with an
English inflection (<i>hablaing</i>).</p>

<p>The immigrant in the midst of a large native population, of
course, exerts no such pressure upon the national language as
that exerted upon an immigrant language by the native, but
nevertheless his linguistic habits and limitations have to be reckoned
with in dealing with him, and the concessions thus made
necessary have a very ponderable influence upon the general
speech. In the usual sense, as we have seen, there are no dialects
in American; two natives, however widely their birthplaces may
be separated, never have any practical difficulty understanding
each other. But there are at least quasi-dialects among the
immigrants—the Irish, the German, the Scandinavian, the Italian,
the Jewish, and so on—and these quasi-dialects undoubtedly
leave occasional marks, not only upon the national vocabulary,
but also upon the general speech habits of the country, as in the
case, for example, of the pronunciation of <i>yes</i>, already mentioned,
and in that of the substitution of the diphthong <i>oi</i> for the <i>ur-</i>sound
in such words as <i>world</i>, <i>journal</i> and <i>burn</i>—a Yiddishism
now almost universal among the lower classes of New York, and
threatening to spread.<a name="FNanchor_56_255" id="FNanchor_56_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_255" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> More important, however, is the support
given to a native tendency by the foreigner's incapacity for
employing (or even comprehending) syntax of any complexity, or
words not of the simplest. This is the tendency toward succinctness <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg159"></a>[Pg159]</span>
and clarity, at whatever sacrifice of grace. One English
observer, Sidney Low, puts the chief blame for the general explosiveness
of American upon the immigrant, who must be communicated
with in the plainest words available, and is not socially
worthy of the suavity of circumlocution anyhow.<a name="FNanchor_57_256" id="FNanchor_57_256"></a><a
href="#Footnote_57_256" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In his turn
the immigrant seizes upon these plainest words as upon a sort of
convenient Lingua Franca—his quick adoption of <i>damn</i> as a universal
adjective is traditional—and throws his influence upon the
side of the underlying speech habit when he gets on in the vulgate.
Many characteristic Americanisms of the sort to stagger
lexicographers—for example, <i>near-silk</i>—have come from the
Jews, whose progress in business is a good deal faster than their
progress in English. Others, as we have seen, have come from
the German immigrants of half a century ago, from the so-called
Pennsylvania Dutch (who are notoriously ignorant and uncouth),
and from the Irish, who brought with them a form of English
already very corrupt. The same and similar elements greatly
reinforce the congenital tendencies of the dialect—toward the
facile manufacture of compounds, toward a disregard of the distinctions
between parts of speech, and, above all, toward the
throwing off of all etymological restraints.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 5</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Processes_of_Word_Formation"></a>Processes of Word Formation</h3>—Some of these tendencies, it
has been pointed out, go back to the period of the first growth of
American, and were inherited from the English of the time.
They are the products of a movement which, reaching its height
in the English of Elizabeth, was dammed up at home, so to speak,
by the rise of linguistic self-consciousness toward the end of the
reign of Anne, but continued almost unobstructed in the colonies.
For example, there is what philologists call the habit of back-formation—a
sort of instinctive search, etymologically unsound,
for short roots in long words. This habit, in Restoration days,
precipitated a quasi-English word, <i>mobile</i>, from the Latin <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg160"></a>[Pg160]</span> <i>mobile
vulgus</i>, and in the days of William and Mary it went a step further
by precipitating <i>mob</i> from <i>mobile</i>. <i>Mob</i> is now sound English,
but in the eighteenth century it was violently attacked by
the new sect of purists,<a name="FNanchor_58_257" id="FNanchor_58_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_257" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and though it survived their onslaught
they undoubtedly greatly impeded the formation and adoption
of other words of the same category. But in the colonies the
process went on unimpeded, save for the feeble protests of such
stray pedants as Witherspoon and Boucher. <i>Rattler</i> for <i>rattlesnake</i>,
<i>pike</i> for <i>turnpike</i>, <i>draw</i> for <i>drawbridge</i>, <i>coon</i> for <i>raccoon</i>,
<i>possum</i> for <i>opossum</i>, <i>cuss</i> for <i>customer</i>, <i>cute</i> for <i>acute</i>, <i>squash</i> for
<i>askutasquash</i>—these American back-formations are already antique;
<i>Sabbaday</i> for <i>Sabbath-day</i> has actually reached the dignity
of an archaism. To this day they are formed in great numbers;
scarcely a new substantive of more than two syllables comes in
without bringing one in its wake. We have thus witnessed,
within the past two years, the genesis of scores now in wide use
and fast taking on respectability; <i>phone</i> for <i>telephone</i>, <i>gas</i> for
<i>gasoline</i>, <i>co-ed</i> for <i>co-educational</i>, <i>pop</i> for <i>populist</i>, <i>frat</i> for <i>fraternity</i>,
<i>gym</i> for <i>gymnasium</i>, <i>movie</i> for <i>moving-picture</i>, <i>prep-school</i>
for <i>preparatory-school</i>, <i>auto</i> for <i>automobile</i>, <i>aero</i> for <i>aeroplane</i>.
Some linger on the edge of vulgarity: <i>pep</i> for <i>pepper</i>, <i>flu</i>
for <i>influenza</i>, <i>plute</i> for <i>plutocrat</i>, <i>pen</i> for <i>penitentiary</i>, <i>con</i> for
<i>confidence</i> (as in <i>con-man</i>, <i>con-game</i> and <i>to con</i>), <i>convict</i> and
<i>consumption</i>, <i>defi</i> for <i>defiance</i>, <i>beaut</i> for <i>beauty</i>, <i>rep</i> for <i>reputation</i>,
<i>stenog</i> for <i>stenographer</i>, <i>ambish</i> for <i>ambition</i>, <i>vag</i> for <i>vagrant</i>,
<i>champ</i> for <i>champion</i>, <i>pard</i> for <i>partner</i>, <i>coke</i> for <i>cocaine</i>,
<i>simp</i> for <i>simpleton</i>, <i>diff</i> for <i>difference</i>. Others are already in
perfectly good usage: <i>smoker</i> for <i>smoking-car</i>, <i>diner</i> for <i>dining-car</i>,
<i>sleeper</i> for <i>sleeping-car</i>, <i>oleo</i> for <i>oleomargarine</i>, <i>hypo</i> for
<i>hyposulphite of soda</i>, <i>Yank</i> for <i>Yankee</i>, <i>confab</i> for <i>confabulation</i>,
<i>memo</i> for <i>memorandum</i>, <i>pop-concert</i> for <i>popular-concert</i>. <i>Ad</i>
for <i>advertisement</i> is struggling hard for recognition; some of its
compounds, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>ad-writer</i>, <i>want-ad</i>, <i>display-ad</i>, <i>ad-card</i>, <i>ad-rate</i>,
<i>column-ad</i> and <i>ad-man</i>, are already accepted in technical terminology.
<i>Boob</i> for <i>booby</i> promises to become sound American in
a few years; its synonyms are no more respectable than it is. At <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg161"></a>[Pg161]</span>
its heels is <i>bo</i> for <i>hobo</i>, an altogether fit successor to <i>bum</i> for
<i>bummer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_258" id="FNanchor_59_258"></a><a
href="#Footnote_59_258" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></div>

<p>A parallel movement shows itself in the great multiplication of
common abbreviations. "Americans, as a rule," says Farmer,
"employ abbreviations to an extent unknown in Europe.... This
trait of the American character is discernible in every department
of the national life and thought."<a name="FNanchor_60_259" id="FNanchor_60_259"></a><a
href="#Footnote_60_259" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> <i>O. K.</i>, <i>C. O. D.</i>,
<i>N. G.</i>, <i>G. O. P.</i> (get out and push) and <i>P. D. Q.</i>, are almost national
hall-marks; the immigrant learns them immediately after
<i>damn</i> and <i>go to hell</i>. Thornton traces <i>N. G.</i> to 1840; <i>C. O. D.</i>
and <i>P. D. Q.</i> are probably as old. As for <i>O. K.</i>, it was in use so
early as 1790, but it apparently did not acquire its present significance
until the 20's; originally it seems to have meant "ordered
recorded."<a href="#Footnote_11_210" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
During the presidential campaign of 1828 Jackson's
enemies, seeking to prove his illiteracy, alleged that he used it for
"oll korrect." Of late the theory has been put forward that it
is derived from an Indian word, <i>okeh</i>, signifying "so be it,"
and Dr. Woodrow Wilson is said to support this theory and to
use <i>okeh</i> in endorsing government papers, but I am unaware of
the authority upon which the etymology is based. Bartlett says
that the figurative use of <i>A No. 1</i>, as in <i>an A No. 1 man</i>, also
originated in America, but this may not be true. There can be
little doubt, however, about <i>T. B.</i> (for <i>tuberculosis</i>), <i>G. B.</i> (for
<i>grand bounce</i>), <i>23</i>, <i>on the Q. T.</i>, and <i>D. &#38; D.</i> (<i>drunk and disorderly</i>).
The language breeds such short forms of speech prodigiously;
every trade and profession has a host of them; they
are innumerable in the slang of sport.<a name="FNanchor_61_260" id="FNanchor_61_260"></a><a
href="#Footnote_61_260" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>What one sees under all this, account for it as one will, is a
double habit, the which is, at bottom, sufficient explanation of
the gap which begins to yawn between English and American,
particularly on the spoken plane. On the one hand it is a habit
of verbal economy—a jealous disinclination to waste two words
on what can be put into one, a natural taste for the brilliant and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg162"></a>[Pg162]</span>
succinct, a disdain of all grammatical and lexicographical daintiness,
born partly, perhaps, of ignorance, but also in part of a
sound sense of their imbecility. And on the other hand there is
a high relish and talent for metaphor—in Brander Matthews'
phrase, "a figurative vigor that the Elizabethans would have
realized and understood." Just as the American rebels instinctively
against such parliamentary circumlocutions as "I am not
prepared to say" and "so much by way of being,"<a name="FNanchor_62_261" id="FNanchor_62_261"></a><a
href="#Footnote_62_261" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> just as he
would fret under the forms of English journalism, with its reporting
empty of drama, its third-person smothering of speeches
and its complex and unintelligible jargon,<a name="FNanchor_63_262" id="FNanchor_63_262"></a><a
href="#Footnote_63_262" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> just so, in his daily
speech and writing he chooses terseness and vividness whenever
there is any choice, and seeks to make one when it doesn't exist.
There is more than mere humorous contrast between the famous
placard in the wash-room of the British Museum: "These Basins
Are For Casual Ablutions Only," and the familiar sign at American
railroad-crossings: "Stop! Look! Listen!" Between the
two lies an abyss separating two cultures, two habits of mind,
two diverging tongues. It is almost unimaginable that Englishmen,
journeying up and down in elevators, would ever have
stricken the teens out of their speech, turning <i>sixteenth</i> into
simple <i>six</i> and <i>twenty-fourth</i> into <i>four</i>; the clipping is almost as
far from their way of doing things as the climbing so high in the
air. Nor have they the brilliant facility of Americans for making
new words of grotesque but penetrating tropes, as in <i>corn-fed</i>,
<i>tight-wad</i>, <i>bone-head</i>, <i>bleachers</i> and <i>juice</i> (for <i>electricity</i>); when
they attempt such things the result is often lugubrious; two hundred
years of schoolmastering has dried up their inspiration.
Nor have they the fine American hand for devising new verbs;
<i>to maffick</i> and <i>to limehouse</i> are their best specimens in twenty
years, and both have an almost pathetic flatness. Their business
with the language, indeed, is not in this department. They are <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg163"></a>[Pg163]</span>
not charged with its raids and scoutings, but with the organization
of its conquests and the guarding of its accumulated stores.</p>

<p>For the student interested in the biology of language, as opposed
to its paleontology, there is endless material in the racy
neologisms of American, and particularly in its new compounds
and novel verbs. Nothing could exceed the brilliancy of such
inventions as <i>joy-ride</i>, <i>high-brow</i>, <i>road-louse</i>, <i>sob-sister</i>, <i>nature-faker</i>,
<i>stand-patter</i>, <i>lounge-lizard</i>, <i>hash-foundry</i>, <i>buzz-wagon</i>,
<i>has-been</i>, <i>end-seat-hog</i>, <i>shoot-the-chutes</i> and <i>grape-juice-diplomacy</i>.
They are bold; they are vivid; they have humor; they
meet genuine needs. <i>Joy-ride</i>, I note, is already going over into
English, and no wonder. There is absolutely no synonym for it;
to convey its idea in orthodox English would take a whole sentence.
And so, too, with certain single words of metaphorical
origin: <i>barrel</i> for large and illicit wealth, <i>pork</i> for unnecessary
and dishonest appropriations of public money, <i>joint</i> for illegal
liquor-house, <i>tenderloin</i> for gay and dubious neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_64_263" id="FNanchor_64_263"></a><a
href="#Footnote_64_263" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Most of these, and of the new compounds with them, belong to
the vocabulary of disparagement. Here an essential character
of the American shows itself: his tendency to combat the disagreeable
with irony, to heap ridicule upon what he is suspicious of
or doesn't understand.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which new verbs are made in the United
States is really quite amazing. Two days after the first regulations
of the Food Administration were announced, <i>to hooverize</i>
appeared spontaneously in scores of newspapers, and a week later
it was employed without any visible sense of its novelty in the
debates of Congress and had taken on a respectability equal to
that of <i>to bryanize</i>, <i>to fletcherize</i> and <i>to oslerize</i>. <i>To electrocute</i>
appeared inevitably in the first public discussion of capital <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg164"></a>[Pg164]</span>
punishment by electricity; <i>to taxi</i> came in with the first taxi-cabs; <i>to
commute</i> no doubt accompanied the first commutation ticket; <i>to
insurge</i> attended the birth of the Progressive balderdash. Of
late the old affix <i>-ize</i>, once fecund of such monsters as <i>to funeralize</i>,
has come into favor again, and I note, among its other products,
<i>to belgiumize</i>, <i>to vacationize</i>, <i>to picturize</i> and <i>to scenarioize</i>.
In a newspaper headline I even find <i>to s o s</i>, in the form of its
gerund.<a name="FNanchor_65_264" id="FNanchor_65_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_264" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Many characteristic American verbs are compounds
of common verbs and prepositions or adverbs, with new meanings
imposed. Compare, for example, <i>to give</i> and <i>to give out</i>, <i>to go
back</i> and <i>to go back on</i>, <i>to beat</i> and <i>to beat it</i>, <i>to light</i> and <i>to
light out</i>, <i>to butt</i> and <i>to butt in</i>, <i>to turn</i> and <i>to turn down</i>, <i>to
show</i> and <i>to show up</i>, <i>to put</i> and <i>to put over</i>, <i>to wind</i> and <i>to
wind up</i>. Sometimes, however, the addition seems to be merely
rhetorical, as in <i>to start off</i>, <i>to finish up</i>, <i>to open up</i> and <i>to hurry
up</i>. <i>To hurry up</i> is so commonplace in America that everyone
uses it and no one notices it, but it remains rare in England.
<i>Up</i> seems to be essential to many of these latter-day verbs, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>to pony up</i>, <i>to doll up</i>, <i>to ball up</i>; without it they are without
significance. Nearly all of them are attended by derivative adjectives
or nouns; <i>cut-up</i>, <i>show-down</i>, <i>kick-in</i>, <i>come-down</i>, <i>hang-out</i>,
<i>start-off</i>, <i>run-in</i>, <i>balled-up</i>, <i>dolled-up</i>, <i>wind-up</i>, <i>bang-up</i>,
<i>turn-down</i>, <i>jump-off</i>.</p>

<p>In many directions the same prodigal fancy shows itself—for
example, in the free interchange of parts of speech, in the bold
inflection of words not inflected in sound English, and in the
invention of wholly artificial words. The first phenomenon has
already concerned us. Would an English literary critic of any
pretensions employ such a locution as "all by her <i>lonesome</i>"? I
have a doubt of it—and yet I find that phrase in a serious book
by the critic of the <cite>New Republic</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_66_265" id="FNanchor_66_265"></a><a
href="#Footnote_66_265" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Would an English M. P.
use "he has another <i>think</i> coming" in debate? Again I doubt
it—but even more anarchistic dedications of verbs and adjectives
to substantival use are to be found in the <cite>Congressional
Record</cite> every day. <i>Jitney</i> is an old American substantive lately <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg165"></a>[Pg165]</span>
revived; a month after its revival it was also an adjective, and
before long it may also be a verb and even an adverb. <i>To lift up</i>
was turned tail first and made a substantive, and is now also an
adjective and a verb. <i>Joy-ride</i> became a verb the day after it
was born as a noun. And what of <i>livest</i>? An astounding inflection,
indeed—but with quite sound American usage behind it.
The <cite>Metropolitan Magazine</cite>, of which Col. Roosevelt is an editor,
announces on its letter paper that it is "the <i>livest</i> magazine in
America," and <i>Poetry</i>, the organ of the new poetry movement,
prints at the head of its contents page the following encomium
from the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>: "the <i>livest</i> art in America today is
poetry, and the <i>livest</i> expression of that art is in this little Chicago
monthly."</p>

<p>Now and then the spirit of American shows a transient faltering,
and its inventiveness is displaced by a banal extension of
meaning, so that a single noun comes to signify discrete things.
Thus <i>laundry</i>, meaning originally a place where linen is washed,
has come to mean also the linen itself. So, again, <i>gun</i> has come
to mean fire-arms of all sorts, and has entered into such compounds
as <i>gun-man</i> and <i>gun-play</i>. And in the same way <i>party</i>
has been borrowed from the terminology of the law and made to
do colloquial duty as a synonym for <i>person</i>. But such evidences
of poverty are rare and abnormal; the whole movement of the
language is toward the multiplication of substantives. A new
object gets a new name, and that new name enters into the common
vocabulary at once. <i>Sundae</i> and <i>hokum</i> are late examples;
their origin is dubious and disputed, but they met genuine needs
and so they seem to be secure. A great many more such substantives
are deliberate inventions, for example, <i>kodak</i>, <i>protectograph</i>,
<i>conductorette</i>, <i>bevo</i>, <i>klaxon</i>, <i>vaseline</i>, <i>jap-a-lac</i>, <i>resinol</i>,
<i>autocar</i>, <i>postum</i>, <i>crisco</i>, <i>electrolier</i>, <i>addressograph</i>, <i>alabastine</i>,
<i>orangeade</i>, <i>pianola</i>, <i>victrola</i>, <i>dictagraph</i>, <i>kitchenette</i>, <i>crispette</i>,
<i>cellarette</i>, <i>uneeda</i>, <i>triscuit</i> and <i>peptomint</i>. Some of these indicate
attempts at description: <i>oleomargarine</i>, <i>phonograph</i> and
<i>gasoline</i> are older examples of that class. Others represent
efforts to devise designations that will meet the conditions of
advertising psychology and the trade-marks law, to wit, that they <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg166"></a>[Pg166]</span>
be (<i>a</i>) new, (<i>b</i>) easily remembered, and (<i>c</i>) not directly descriptive.
Probably the most successful invention of this sort is
<i>kodak</i>, which was devised by George Eastman, inventor of the
portable camera so called. <i>Kodak</i> has so far won acceptance as
a common noun that Eastman is often forced to assert his proprietary
right to it.<a name="FNanchor_67_266" id="FNanchor_67_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_266" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> <i>Vaseline</i> is in the same position. The
annual crop of such inventions in the United States is enormous.<a name="FNanchor_68_267" id="FNanchor_68_267"></a><a
href="#Footnote_68_267" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
The majority die, but a hearty few always survive.</p>

<p>Of analogous character are artificial words of the <i>scalawag</i> and
<i>rambunctious</i> class, the formation of which constantly goes on.
Some of them are shortened compounds: <i>grandificent</i> (from
<i>grand</i> and <i>magnificent</i>), <i>sodalicious</i> (from <i>soda</i> and <i>delicious</i>)
and <i>warphan</i>(<i>age</i>) (from <i>war</i> and <i>orphan</i>(<i>age</i>)).<a name="FNanchor_69_268" id="FNanchor_69_268"></a><a
href="#Footnote_69_268" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Others are
made up of common roots and grotesque affixes: <i>swelldoodle</i>,
<i>splendiferous</i> and <i>peacharino</i>. Yet others are mere extravagant
inventions: <i>scallywampus</i>, <i>supergobsloptious</i> and <i>floozy</i>. Most
of these are devised by advertisement writers or college students,
and belong properly to slang, but there is a steady movement of
selected specimens into the common vocabulary. The words in <i>-doodle</i>
hint at German influences, and those in <i>-ino</i> owe something
to Italian, or at least to popular burlesques of what is conceived
to be Italian.</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Pronunciation-166"></a>Pronunciation</h3>—"Language," said Sayce, in 1879, "does not
consist of letters, but of sounds, and until this fact has been
brought home to us our study of it will be little better than an <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg167"></a>[Pg167]</span>
exercise of memory."<a name="FNanchor_70_269" id="FNanchor_70_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_269" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The theory, at that time, was somewhat
strange to English grammarians and etymologists, despite the
investigations of A. J. Ellis and the massive lesson of Grimm's
law; their labors were largely wasted upon deductions from the
written word. But since then, chiefly under the influence of
Continental philologists, and particularly of the Dane, J. O. H.
Jespersen, they have turned from orthographical futilities to the
actual sounds of the tongue, and the latest and best grammar of
it, that of Sweet, is frankly based upon the spoken English of
educated Englishmen—not, remember, of conscious purists, but
of the general body of cultivated folk. Unluckily, this new
method also has its disadvantages. The men of a given race and
time usually write a good deal alike, or, at all events, attempt to
write alike, but in their oral speech there are wide variations.
"No two persons," says a leading contemporary authority upon
English phonetics,<a name="FNanchor_71_270" id="FNanchor_71_270"></a><a
href="#Footnote_71_270" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
"pronounce exactly alike." Moreover,
"even the best speaker commonly uses more than one style."
The result is that it is extremely difficult to determine the prevailing
pronunciation of a given combination of letters at any
time and place. The persons whose speech is studied pronounce
it with minute shades of difference, and admit other differences
according as they are conversing naturally or endeavoring to
exhibit their pronunciation. Worse, it is impossible to represent
a great many of these shades in print. Sweet, trying to do it,<a name="FNanchor_72_271" id="FNanchor_72_271"></a><a
href="#Footnote_72_271" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
found himself, in the end, with a preposterous alphabet of 125
letters. Prince L.-L. Bonaparte more than doubled this number,
and Ellis brought it to 390.<a name="FNanchor_73_272"
id="FNanchor_73_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_272" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Other phonologists, English and
Continental, have gone floundering into the same bog. The dictionary-makers,
forced to a far greater economy of means, are
brought into obscurity. The difficulties of the enterprise, in
fact, are probably unsurmountable. It is, as White says, "almost
impossible for one person to express to another by signs the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg168"></a>[Pg168]</span>
sound of any word." "Only the voice," he goes on, "is capable
of that; for the moment a sign is used the question arises, What is
the value of that sign? The sounds of words are the most delicate,
fleeting and inapprehensible things in nature.... Moreover,
the question arises as to the capability to apprehend and
distinguish sounds on the part of the person whose evidence is
given."<a name="FNanchor_74_273" id="FNanchor_74_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_273" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Certain German orthoepists, despairing of the printed
page, have turned to the phonograph, and there is a Deutsche
Grammophon-Gesellschaft in Berlin which offers records of specimen
speeches in a great many languages and dialects, including
English. The phonograph has also been put to successful use in
language teaching by various American correspondence schools.</div>

<p>In view of all this it would be hopeless to attempt to exhibit in
print the numerous small differences between English and American
pronunciation, for many of them are extremely delicate and
subtle, and only their aggregation makes them plain. According
to a recent and very careful observer,<a name="FNanchor_75_274" id="FNanchor_75_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_274" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the most important of
them do not lie in pronunciation at all, properly so called, but in
intonation. In this direction, he says, one must look for the true
characters "of the English accent." I incline to agree with
White,<a name="FNanchor_76_275" id="FNanchor_76_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_275" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that the pitch of the English voice is somewhat higher
than that of the American, and that it is thus more penetrating.
The nasal twang which Englishmen observe in the <i class="abblatin">vox Americana</i>,
though it has high overtones, is itself not high pitched, but
rather low pitched, as all constrained and muffled tones are apt
to be. The causes of that twang have long engaged phonologists,
and in the main they agree that there is a physical basis for it—that
our generally dry climate and rapid changes of temperature
produce an actual thickening of the membranes concerned in the
production of sound.<a name="FNanchor_77_276" id="FNanchor_77_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_276" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> We are, in brief, a somewhat snuffling <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg169"></a>[Pg169]</span>
people, and much more given to catarrhs and coryzas than the
inhabitants of damp Britain. Perhaps this general impediment
to free and easy utterance, subconsciously apprehended, is responsible
for the American tendency to pronounce the separate
syllables of a word with much more care than an Englishman
bestows upon them; the American, in giving <i>extraordinary</i> six
distinct syllables instead of the Englishman's grudging four,
may be seeking to make up for his natural disability. Marsh, in
his "Lectures on the English Language,"<a name="FNanchor_78_277" id="FNanchor_78_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_277" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> sought two other
explanations of the fact. On the one hand, he argued that the
Americans of his day read a great deal more than the English,
and were thus much more influenced by the spelling of words,
and on the other hand he pointed out that "our flora shows that
the climate of even our Northern States belongs ... to a more
Southern type than that of England," and that "in Southern
latitudes ... articulation is generally much more distinct than
in Northern regions." In support of the latter proposition he
cited the pronunciation of Spanish, Italian and Turkish, as compared
with that of English, Danish and German—rather unfortunate
examples, for the pronunciation of German is at least as
clear as that of Italian. Swedish would have supported his case
far better: the Swedes debase their vowels and slide over their
consonants even more markedly than the English. Marsh believed
that there was a tendency among Southern peoples to
throw the accent back, and that this helped to "bring out all the
syllables." One finds a certain support for this notion in various
American peculiarities of stress. <i>Advertisement</i> offers an
example. The prevailing American pronunciation, despite incessant
pedagogical counterblasts, puts the accent on the penult,
whereas the English pronunciation stresses the second syllable.
<i>Paresis</i> illustrates the same tendency. The English accent the
first syllable, but, as Krapp says, American usage clings to the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg170"></a>[Pg170]</span>
accent on the second syllable.<a name="FNanchor_79_278" id="FNanchor_79_278"></a><a
href="#Footnote_79_278" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> There are, again, <i>pianist</i>, <i>primarily</i>
and <i>telegrapher</i>. The English accent the first syllable of
each; we commonly accent the second. In <i>temporarily</i> they also
accent the first; we accent the third. Various other examples
might be cited. But when one had marshalled them their significance
would be at once set at naught by four very familiar
words, <i>mamma</i>, <i>papa</i>, <i>inquiry</i> and <i>ally</i>. Americans almost invariably
accent each on the first syllable; Englishmen stress the
second. For months, during 1918, the publishers of the Standard
Dictionary, advertising that work in the street-cars, explained
that <i>ally</i> should be accented on the second syllable, and pointed
out that owners of their dictionary were safeguarded against the
vulgarism of accenting it on the first. Nevertheless, this free and
highly public instruction did not suffice to exterminate <i>al´ly</i>. I
made note of the pronunciations overheard, with the word constantly
on all lips. But one man of my acquaintance regularly
accented the second syllable, and he was an eminent scholar,
professionally devoted to the study of language.</p>

<p>Thus it is unsafe, here as elsewhere, to generalize too facilely,
and particularly unsafe to exhibit causes with too much assurance.
"Man frage nicht warum," says Philipp Karl Buttmann.
"Der Sprachgebrauch lässt sich nur beobachten."<a name="FNanchor_80_279" id="FNanchor_80_279"></a><a
href="#Footnote_80_279" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But the
greater distinctness of American utterance, whatever its genesis
and machinery, is palpable enough in many familiar situations.
"The typical American accent," says Vizetelly, "is often harsh
and unmusical, but it sounds all of the letters to be sounded, and
slurs, but does not distort, the rest."<a name="FNanchor_81_280" id="FNanchor_81_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_280" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> An American, for example,
almost always sounds the first <i>l</i> in <i>fulfill</i>; an Englishman
makes the first syllable <i>foo</i>. An American sounds every syllable
in <i>extraordinary</i>, <i>literary</i>, <i>military</i>, <i>secretary</i> and the other
words of the <i>-ary</i>-group; an Englishman never pronounces the <i>a</i>
of the penultimate syllable. <i>Kindness</i>, with the <i>d</i> silent, would
attract notice in the United States; in England, according to <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg171"></a>[Pg171]</span>
Jones,<a name="FNanchor_82_281" id="FNanchor_82_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_281" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the <i>d</i> is "very commonly, if not usually" omitted.
<i>Often</i>, in America, commonly retains a full <i>t</i>; in England it is
actually and officially <i>offen</i>. Let an American and an Englishman
pronounce <i>program</i> (<i>me</i>). Though the Englishman retains
the long form of the last syllable in writing, he reduces it in
speaking to a thick triple consonant, <i>grm</i>; the American enunciates
it clearly, rhyming it with <i>damn</i>. Or try the two with any
word ending in <i>-g</i>, say <i>sporting</i> or <i>ripping</i>. Or with any word
having <i>r</i> before a consonant, say <i>card</i>, <i>harbor</i>, <i>lord</i> or <i>preferred</i>.
"The majority of Englishmen," says Menner, "certainly do not
pronounce the <i>r</i> ...; just as certainly the majority of educated
Americans pronounce it distinctly."<a name="FNanchor_83_282" id="FNanchor_83_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_282" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Henry James, visiting
the United States after many years of residence in England, was
much harassed by this persistent <i>r</i>-sound, which seemed to him to
resemble "a sort of morose grinding of the back teeth."<a name="FNanchor_84_283" id="FNanchor_84_283"></a><a
href="#Footnote_84_283" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> So
sensitive to it did he become that he began to hear where it was
actually non-existent, save as an occasional barbarism, for example,
in <i>Cuba-r</i>, <i>vanilla-r</i> and <i>California-r</i>. He put the blame for
it, and for various other departures from the strict canon of contemporary
English, upon "the American common school, the
American newspaper, and the American Dutchman and Dago."
Unluckily for his case, the full voicing of the <i>r</i> came into American
long before the appearance of any of these influences. The
early colonists, in fact, brought it with them from England, and
it still prevailed there in Dr. Johnson's day, for he protested
publicly against the "rough snarling sound" and led the movement
which finally resulted in its extinction.<a name="FNanchor_85_284" id="FNanchor_85_284"></a><a
href="#Footnote_85_284" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Today, extinct,
it is mourned by English purists, and the Poet Laureate denounces
the clergy of the Established Church for saying "the
<i>sawed</i> of the <i>Laud</i>" instead of "the sword of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_86_285" id="FNanchor_86_285"></a><a
href="#Footnote_86_285" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>But even in the matter of elided consonants American is not
always the conservator. We cling to the <i>r</i>, we preserve the final <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg172"></a>[Pg172]</span>
<i>g</i>, we give <i>nephew</i> a clear <i>f</i>-sound instead of the clouded English
<i>v</i>-sound, and we boldly nationalize <i>trait</i> and pronounce its final <i>t</i>,
but we drop the second <i>p</i> from <i>pumpkin</i> and change the <i>m</i> to <i>n</i>,
we change the <i>ph</i>(=<i>f</i>)-sound to plain <i>p</i> in <i>diphtheria</i>, <i>diphthong</i>
and <i>naphtha</i>,<a name="FNanchor_87_286" id="FNanchor_87_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_286" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> we relieve <i>rind</i> of its final <i>d</i>, and, in the
complete sentence, we slaughter consonants by assimilation. I
have heard Englishmen say <i>brand-new</i>, but on American lips it
is almost invariably <i>bran-new</i>. So nearly universal is this nasalization
in the United States that certain American lexicographers
have sought to found the term upon <i>bran</i> and not upon <i>brand</i>.
Here the national speech is powerfully influenced by Southern
dialectical variations, which in turn probably derive partly from
French example and partly from the linguistic limitations of the
negro. The latter, even after two hundred years, has great difficulties
with our consonants, and often drops them. A familiar
anecdote well illustrates his speech habit. On a train stopping
at a small station in Georgia a darkey threw up a window and
yelled "Wah ee?" The reply from a black on the platform was
"Wah oo?" A Northerner aboard the train, puzzled by this
inarticulate dialogue, sought light from a Southern passenger,
who promptly translated the first question as "Where is he?"
and the second as "Where is who?" A recent viewer with
alarm<a name="FNanchor_88_287" id="FNanchor_88_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_287" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> argues that this conspiracy against the consonants is
spreading, and that English printed words no longer represent
the actual sounds of the American language. "Like the French,"
he says, "we have a marked <i>liaison</i>—the borrowing of a letter
from the preceding word. We invite one another to 'c'meer'
(=come here) ... 'Hoo-zat?' (=who is that?) has as good a
<i>liaison</i> as the French <i>vois avez</i>." This critic believes that American
tends to abandon <i>t</i> for <i>d</i>, as in <i>Sadd'y</i> (=Saturday) and
<i>siddup</i> (=sit up), and to get rid of <i>h</i>, as in "ware-zee?"
(=where is he?). But here we invade the vulgar speech, which
belongs to the next chapter. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg173"></a>[Pg173]</span></p>

<p>Among the vowels the most salient difference between English
and American pronunciation, of course, is marked off by the flat
American <i>a</i>. This flat <i>a</i>, as we have seen, has been under attack
at home for nearly a century. The New Englanders, very sensitive
to English example, substitute a broad <i>a</i> that is even
broader than the English, and an <i>a</i> of the same sort survives in
the South in a few words, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>master</i>, <i>tomato</i> and <i>tassel</i>, but
everywhere else in the country the flat <i>a</i> prevails. Fashion and
the example of the stage oppose it,<a name="FNanchor_89_288" id="FNanchor_89_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_288" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and it is under the ban of
an active wing of schoolmasters, but it will not down. To the
average American, indeed, the broad <i>a</i> is a banner of affectation,
and he associates it unpleasantly with spats, Harvard, male tea-drinking,
wrist watches and all the other objects of his social
suspicion. He gets the flat sound, not only into such words as
<i>last</i>, <i>calf</i>, <i>dance</i> and <i>pastor</i>, but even into <i>piano</i> and <i>drama</i>.
<i>Drama</i> is sometimes <i>drayma</i> west of Connecticut, but almost
never <i>drahma</i> or <i>drawma</i>. <i>Tomato</i> with the <i>a</i> of <i>bat</i>, may sometimes
borrow the <i>a</i> of <i>plate</i>, but <i>tomahto</i> is confined to New England
and the South. <i>Hurrah</i>, in American, has also borrowed
the <i>a</i> of <i>plate</i>; one hears <i>hurray</i> much oftener than <i>hurraw</i>.
Even <i>amen</i> frequently shows that <i>a</i>, though not when sung.
Curiously enough, it is displaced in <i>patent</i> by the true flat <i>a</i>.
The English rhyme the first syllable of the word with <i>rate</i>; in
America it always rhymes with <i>rat</i>.</p>

<p>The broad <i>a</i> is not only almost extinct outside of New England;
it begins to show signs of decay even there. At all events, it has
gradually disappeared from many words, and is measurably less
sonorous in those in which it survives than it used to be. A
century ago it appeared, not only in <i>dance</i>, <i>aunt</i>, <i>glass</i>, <i>past</i>, etc.,
but also in <i>Daniel</i>, <i>imagine</i>, <i>rational</i> and <i>travel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_90_289" id="FNanchor_90_289"></a><a
href="#Footnote_90_289" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> And in 1857
Oliver Wendell Holmes reported it in <i>matter</i>, <i>handsome</i>, <i>caterpillar</i>,
<i>apple</i> and <i>satisfaction</i>. It has been displaced in virtually
all of these, even in the most remote reaches of the back country, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg174"></a>[Pg174]</span>
by the national flat <i>a</i>. Grandgent<a name="FNanchor_91_290" id="FNanchor_91_290"></a><a
href="#Footnote_91_290" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> says that the broad <i>a</i> is now
restricted in New England to the following situations:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<p>1. when followed by <i>s</i> or <i>ns</i>, as in <i>last</i> and <i>dance</i>.</p>

<p>2. when followed by <i>r</i> preceding another consonant, as in <i>cart</i>.</p>

<p>3. when followed by <i>lm</i>, as in <i>calm</i>.</p>

<p>4. when followed by <i>f</i>, <i>s</i> or <i>th</i>, as in <i>laugh</i>, <i>pass</i> and <i>path</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>u</i>-sound also shows certain differences between English
and American usage. The English reduce the last syllable of
<i>figure</i> to <i>ger</i>; the educated American preserves the <i>u</i>-sound as
in <i>nature</i>. The English make the first syllable of <i>courteous</i>
rhyme with <i>fort</i>; the American standard rhymes it with <i>hurt</i>.
The English give an <i>oo</i>-sound to the <i>u</i> of <i>brusque</i>; in America
the word commonly rhymes with <i>tusk</i>. A <i>u</i>-sound, as everyone
knows, gets into the American pronunciation of <i>clerk</i>, by analogy
with <i>insert</i>; the English cling to a broad <i>a</i>-sound, by analogy
with <i>hearth</i>. Even the latter, in the United States, is often pronounced
to rhyme with <i>dearth</i>. The American, in general, is
much less careful than the Englishman to preserve the shadowy
<i>y</i>-sound before <i>u</i> in words of the <i>duke</i>-class. He retains it in
<i>few</i>, but surely not in <i>new</i>. Nor in <i>duke</i>, <i>blue</i>, <i>stew</i>, <i>due</i>, <i>duty</i>
and <i>true</i>. Nor even in <i>Tuesday</i>. Purists often attack the simple
<i>oo</i>-sound. In 1912, for example, the Department of Education
of New York City warned all the municipal high-school
teachers to combat it.<a name="FNanchor_92_291" id="FNanchor_92_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_291" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> But it is doubtful that one pupil in a
hundred was thereby induced to insert the <i>y</i> in <i>induced</i>. Finally
there is <i>lieutenant</i>. The Englishman pronounces the first syllable
<i>left</i>; the American invariably makes it <i>loot</i>. White says that
the prevailing American pronunciation is relatively recent. "I
never heard it," he reports, "in my boyhood."<a name="FNanchor_93_292" id="FNanchor_93_292"></a><a
href="#Footnote_93_292" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He was born
in New York in 1821.</p>

<p>The <i>i</i>-sound presents several curious differences. The English
make it long in all words of the <i>hostile</i>-class; in America it
is commonly short, even in <i>puerile</i>. The English also lengthen
it in <i>sliver</i>; in America the word usually rhymes with <i>liver</i>. The <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg175"></a>[Pg175]</span>
short <i>i</i>, in England, is almost universally substituted for the <i>e</i>
in <i>pretty</i>, and this pronunciation is also inculcated in most American
schools, but I often hear an unmistakable <i>e</i>-sound in the
United States, making the first syllable rhyme with <i>bet</i>. Contrariwise,
most Americans put the short <i>i</i> into <i>been</i>, making it
rhyme with <i>sin</i>. In England it shows a long <i>e</i>-sound, as in <i>seen</i>.
A recent poem by an English poet makes the word rhyme with
<i>submarine</i>, <i>queen</i> and <i>unseen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94_293" id="FNanchor_94_293"></a><a
href="#Footnote_94_293" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The <i>o</i>-sound, in American,
tends to convert itself into an <i>aw</i>-sound. <i>Cog</i> still retains a
pure <i>o</i>, but one seldom hears it in <i>log</i> or <i>dog</i>. Henry James
denounces this "flatly-drawling group" in "The Question of
Our Speech,"<a name="FNanchor_95_294" id="FNanchor_95_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_294" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and cites <i>gawd</i>, <i>dawg</i>, <i>sawft</i>, <i>lawft</i>, <i>gawne</i>,
<i>lawst</i> and <i>frawst</i> as horrible examples. But the English themselves
are not guiltless of the same fault. Many of the accusations
that James levels at American, in truth, are echoed by Robert
Bridges in "A Tract on the Present State of English Pronunciation."
Both spend themselves upon opposing what, at
bottom, are probably natural and inevitable movements—for
example, the gradual decay of all the vowels to one of neutral
color, represented by the <i>e</i> of <i>danger</i>, the <i>u</i> of <i>suggest</i>, the second
<i>o</i> of <i>common</i> and the <i>a</i> of <i>prevalent</i>. This decay shows
itself in many languages. In both English and High German,
during their middle periods, all the terminal vowels degenerated
to <i>e</i>—now sunk to the aforesaid neutral vowel in many German
words, and expunged from English altogether. The same sound
is encountered in languages so widely differing otherwise as
Arabic, French and Swedish. "Its existence," says Sayce, "is
a sign of age and decay; meaning has become more important
than outward form, and the educated intelligence no longer
demands a clear pronunciation in order to understand what is
said."<a name="FNanchor_96_295" id="FNanchor_96_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_295" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>All these differences between English and American pronunciation,
separately considered, seem slight, but in the aggregate
they are sufficient to place serious impediments between mutual <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg176"></a>[Pg176]</span>
comprehension. Let an Englishman and an American (not of
New England) speak a quite ordinary sentence, "My aunt can't
answer for my dancing the lancers even passably," and at once
the gap separating the two pronunciations will be manifest.
Here only the <i>a</i> is involved. Add a dozen everyday words—<i>military</i>,
<i>schedule</i>, <i>trait</i>, <i>hostile</i>, <i>been</i>, <i>lieutenant</i>, <i>patent</i>, <i>nephew</i>,
<i>secretary</i>, <i>advertisement</i>, and so on—and the strangeness of one
to the other is augmented. "Every Englishman visiting the
States for the first time," said an English dramatist some time
ago, "has a difficulty in making himself understood. He often
has to repeat a remark or a request two or three times to make
his meaning clear, especially on railroads, in hotels and at bars.
The American visiting England for the first time has the same
trouble."<a name="FNanchor_97_296" id="FNanchor_97_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_296" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Despite the fact that American actors imitate English
pronunciation to the best of their skill, this visiting Englishman
asserted that the average American audience is incapable
of understanding a genuinely English company, at least
"when the speeches are rattled off in conversational style."
When he presented one of his own plays with an English company,
he said, many American acquaintances, after witnessing
the performance, asked him to lend them the manuscript, "that
they might visit it again with some understanding of the dialogue."<a name="FNanchor_98_297" id="FNanchor_98_297"></a><a

<i>To bluff</i> has also gone into other languages, notably the Spanish. During
the Cuban revolution of March, 1917, the newspapers of Havana, objecting
to the dispatches sent out by American correspondents, denounced the latter
as <i>los blofistas</i>. Meanwhile, <i>to bluff</i> has been shouldered out in the country
of its origin, at least temporarily, by a verb borrowed from the French,
<i>to camouflage</i>. This first appeared in the Spring of 1917.</p></div>

is not to be overlooked. Joyce says flatly (English As We Speak It in

American society chiefly through the influence of the Irish." At all events,
the Irish example must have reinforced it. In Ireland "<i>Will</i> I light the

class="label">[46]</span></a> In Yiddish, <i>ish ka bibble</i>. The origin and meaning of the phrase
have been variously explained. The prevailing notion seems to be that it is
a Yiddish corruption of the German <i>nicht gefiedelt</i> (=<i>not fiddled</i>=<i>not
flustered</i>). But this seems to me to be fanciful. To the Jews <i>ish</i> is obviously
the first personal pronoun and <i>kaa</i> probably corruption of <i>kann</i>.
As for <i>bibble</i> I suspect that it is the offspring of <i>bedibbert</i> (=<i>embarrassed</i>,
<i>intimidated</i>). The phrase thus has an ironical meaning, <i>I should be embarrassed</i>,
almost precisely equivalent to <i>I should worry</i>.</p></div>

The Common Speech</h2>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Grammarians_and_Their_Ways"></a>
Grammarians and Their Ways</h3>
—So far, in the main, the language
examined has been of a relatively pretentious and self-conscious
variety—the speech, if not always of formal discourse,
then at least of literate men. Most of the examples of its vocabulary
and idiom, in fact, have been drawn from written documents
or from written reports of more or less careful utterances,
for example, the speeches of members of Congress and of other
public men. The whole of Thornton's excellent material is of
this character. In his dictionary there is scarcely a locution
that is not supported by printed examples.</div>

<p>It must be obvious that such materials, however lavishly set
forth, cannot exhibit the methods and tendencies of a living
speech with anything approaching completeness, nor even with
accuracy. What men put into writing and what they say when
they take sober thought are very far from what they utter in
everyday conversation. All of us, no matter how careful our
speech habits, loosen the belt a bit, so to speak, when we speak
familiarly to our fellows, and pay a good deal less heed to
precedents and proprieties, perhaps, than we ought to. It was
a sure instinct that made Ibsen put "bad grammar" into the
mouth of Nora Helmar in "A Doll's House." She is a general's
daughter and the wife of a professor, but even professor's
wives are not above occasional bogglings of the cases of pronouns
and the conjugations of verbs. The professors themselves,
in truth, must have the same habit, for sometimes they
show plain signs of it in print. More than once, plowing through
profound and interminable treatises of grammar and syntax in <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg178"></a>[Pg178]</span>
preparation for the present work, I have encountered the cheering
spectacle of one grammarian exposing, with contagious joy,
the grammatical lapses of some other grammarian. And nine
times out of ten, a few pages further on, I have found the enchanted
purist erring himself.<a name="FNanchor_1_298" id="FNanchor_1_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_298" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The most funereal of the sciences
is saved from utter horror by such displays of human
malice and fallibility. Speech itself, indeed, would become almost
impossible if the grammarians could follow their own rules
unfailingly, and were always right.</p>

<p>But here we are among the learned; and their sins, when
detected and exposed, are at least punished by conscience. What
are of more importance, to those interested in language as a
living thing, are the offendings of the millions who are not
conscious of any wrong. It is among these millions, ignorant
of regulation and eager only to express their ideas clearly and
forcefully, that language undergoes its great changes and constantly
renews its vitality. These are the genuine makers of
grammar, marching miles ahead of the formal grammarians.
Like the Emperor Sigismund, each man among them may well
say: "<i class="abblatin">Ego sum ... super grammaticam</i>." It is competent for
any individual to offer his contribution—his new word, his better
idiom, his novel figure of speech, his short cut in grammar
or syntax—and it is by the general vote of the whole body, not
by the verdict of a small school, that the fate of the innovation
is decided. As Brander Matthews says, there is not even
representative government in the matter; the <i class="abblatin">posse comitatus</i>
decides directly, and despite the sternest protest, finally. The
ignorant, the rebellious and the daring come forward with their
brilliant barbarisms; the learned and conservative bring up
their objections. "And when both sides have been heard, there
is a show of hands; and by this the irrevocable decision of the
community itself is rendered."<a name="FNanchor_2_299" id="FNanchor_2_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_299" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Thus it was that the Romance
languages were fashioned out of the wreck of Latin, the vast <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg179"></a>[Pg179]</span>
influence of the literate minority to the contrary notwithstanding.
Thus it was, too, that English lost its case inflections and many
of its old conjugations, and that our <i>yes</i> came to be substituted
for the <i>gea-se</i> (=<i>so be it</i>) of an earlier day, and that we got rid
of <i>whom</i> after <i>man</i> in <i>the man I saw</i>, and that our stark pronoun
of the first person was precipitated from the German <i>ich</i>.
And thus it is that, in our own day, the language faces forces
in America which, not content with overhauling and greatly
enriching its materials, now threaten to work changes in its very
structure.</p>

<p>Where these tendencies run strongest, of course, is on the
plane of the vulgar spoken language. Among all classes the
everyday speech departs very far from orthodox English, and
even very far from any recognizable spoken English, but among
those lower classes which make up the great body of the people
it gets so far from orthodox English that it gives promise, soon
or late, of throwing off its old bonds altogether, or, at any rate,
all save the loosest of them. Behind it is the gigantic impulse
that I have described in earlier chapters: the impulse of an
egoistic and iconoclastic people, facing a new order of life in
highly self-conscious freedom, to break a relatively stable language,
long since emerged from its period of growth, to their
novel and multitudinous needs, and, above all, to their experimental
and impatient spirit. This impulse, it must be plain,
would war fiercely upon any attempt at formal regulation, however
prudent and elastic; it is often rebellious for the mere sake
of rebellion. But what it comes into conflict with, in America,
is nothing so politic, and hence nothing so likely to keep the
brakes upon it. What it actually encounters here is a formalism
that is artificial, illogical and almost unintelligible—a
formalism borrowed from English grammarians, and by them
brought into English, against all fact and reason, from the Latin.
"In most of our grammars, perhaps in all of those issued earlier
than the opening of the twentieth century," says Matthews, "we
find linguistic laws laid down which are in blank contradiction
with the genius of the language."<a name="FNanchor_3_300" id="FNanchor_3_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_300" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In brief, the American <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg180"></a>[Pg180]</span>
school-boy, hauled before a pedagogue to be instructed in the
structure and organization of the tongue he speaks, is actually
instructed in the structure and organization of a tongue that he
never hears at all, and seldom reads, and that, in more than one
of the characters thus set before him, does not even exist.</p>

<p>The effects of this are two-fold. On the one hand he conceives
an antipathy to a subject so lacking in intelligibility and utility.
As one teacher puts it, "pupils tire of it; often they see nothing
in it, because there <i>is</i> nothing in it."<a name="FNanchor_4_301" id="FNanchor_4_301"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_301" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And on the other
hand, the school-boy goes entirely without sympathetic guidance
in the living language that he actually speaks, in and out of the
classroom, and that he will probably speak all the rest of his
life. All he hears in relation to it is a series of sneers and prohibitions,
most of them grounded, not upon principles deduced
from its own nature, but upon its divergences from the theoretical
language that he is so unsuccessfully taught. The net result
is that all the instruction he receives passes for naught. It is
not sufficient to make him a master of orthodox English and it
is not sufficient to rid him of the speech-habits of his home and
daily life. Thus he is thrown back upon these speech-habits
without any helpful restraint or guidance, and they make him
a willing ally of the radical and often extravagant tendencies
which show themselves in the vulgar tongue. In other words,
the very effort to teach him an excessively tight and formal
English promotes his use of a loose and rebellious English. And
so the grammarians, with the traditional fatuity of their order,
labor for the destruction of the grammar they defend, and for
the decay of all those refinements of speech that go with it.</p>

<p>The folly of this system, of course, has not failed to attract
the attention of the more intelligent teachers, nor have they
failed to observe the causes of its failure. "Much of the fruitlessness
of the study of English grammar," says Wilcox,<a name="FNanchor_5_302" id="FNanchor_5_302"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5_302" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "and
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg181"></a><span class="hidden">[Pg181]</span></span>
many of the obstacles encountered in its study are due to 'the
difficulties created by the grammarians.' These difficulties arise
chiefly from three sources—excessive classification, multiplication
of terms for a single conception, and the attempt to treat
the English language as if it were highly inflected." So long
ago as the 60's Richard Grant White began an onslaught upon
all such punditic stupidities. He saw clearly that "the attempt
to treat English as if it were highly inflected" was making its
intelligent study almost impossible, and proposed boldly that
all English grammar-books be burned.<a name="FNanchor_6_303" id="FNanchor_6_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_303" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of late his ideas have
begun to gain a certain acceptance, and as the literature of denunciation
has grown<a name="FNanchor_7_304" id="FNanchor_7_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_304" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the grammarians have been constrained
to overhaul their texts. When I was a school-boy, during the
penultimate decade of the last century, the chief American grammar
was "A Practical Grammar of the English Language," by
Thomas W. Harvey.<a name="FNanchor_8_305" id="FNanchor_8_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_305" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This formidable work was almost purely
synthetical: it began with a long series of definitions, wholly unintelligible
to a child, and proceeded into a maddening maze of
pedagogical distinctions, puzzling even to an adult. The latter-day
grammars, at least those for the elementary schools, are far
more analytical and logical. For example, there is "Longmans'
Briefer Grammar," by George J. Smith,<a name="FNanchor_9_306" id="FNanchor_9_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_306" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a text now in very
wide use. This book starts off, not with page after page of
abstractions, but with a well-devised examination of the complete
sentence, and the characters and relations of the parts of speech
are very simply and clearly developed. But before the end the
author begins to succumb to precedent, and on page 114 I find <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg182"></a>[Pg182]</span>
paragraph after paragraph of such dull, flyblown pedantry as
this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>Some Intransitive Verbs are used to link the Subject and some Adjective
or Noun. These Verbs are called Copulative Verbs, and the
Adjective or Noun is called the Attribute.</div>

<div>The Attribute always describes or denotes the person or thing denoted
by the Subject.</div>

<div>Verbals are words that are derived from Verbs and express action
or being without asserting it. Infinitives and Participles are
Verbals.</div></div>

<p>And so on. Smith, in his preface, says that his book is intended,
"not so much to 'cover' the subject of grammar as to
<i>teach</i> it," and calls attention to the fact, somewhat proudly, that
he has omitted "the rather hard subject of gerunds," all mention
of conjunctive adverbs, and even the conjugation of verbs.
Nevertheless, he immerses himself in the mythical objective case
of nouns on page 108, and does not emerge until the end.<a name="FNanchor_10_307" id="FNanchor_10_307"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10_307" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
"The New-Webster-Cooley Course in English,"<a name="FNanchor_11_308" id="FNanchor_11_308"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11_308" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> another popular
text, carries reform a step further. The subject of case is
approached through the personal pronouns, where it retains its
only surviving intelligibility, and the more lucid <em>object form</em>
is used in place of <em>objective case</em>. Moreover, the pupil is plainly
informed, later on, that "a noun has in reality but two case-forms:
a possessive and a common case-form." This is the best
concession to the facts yet made by a text-book grammarian.
But no one familiar with the habits of the pedagogical mind need
be told that its interior pull is against even such mild and obvious
reforms. Defenders of the old order are by no means silent;
a fear seems to prevail that grammar, robbed of its imbecile
classifications, may collapse entirely. Wilcox records how the
Council of English Teachers of New Jersey, but a few years ago,
spoke out boldly for the recognition of no less than five cases <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg183"></a>[Pg183]</span>
in English. "Why five?" asks Wilcox. "Why not eight, or
ten, or even thirteen? Undoubtedly because there are five cases
in Latin."<a name="FNanchor_12_309" id="FNanchor_12_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_309" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Most of the current efforts at improvement, in
fact, tend toward a mere revision and multiplication of classifications;
the pedant is eternally convinced that pigeon-holing
and relabelling are contributions to knowledge. A curious proof
in point is offered by a pamphlet entitled "Reorganization of
English in Secondary Schools," compiled by James Fleming
Hosic and issued by the National Bureau of Education.<a name="FNanchor_13_310" id="FNanchor_13_310"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13_310" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
aim of this pamphlet is to rid the teaching of English, including
grammar, of its accumulated formalism and ineffectiveness—to
make it genuine instruction instead of a pedantic and meaningless
routine. And how is this revolutionary aim set forth? By
a meticulous and merciless splitting of hairs, a gigantic manufacture
of classifications and sub-classifications, a colossal display
of professorial bombast and flatulence.</p>

<p>I could cite many other examples. Perhaps, after all, the disease
is incurable. What such laborious stupidity shows at bottom
is simply this: that the sort of man who is willing to devote
his life to teaching grammar to children, or to training school-marms
to do it, is not often the sort of man who is intelligent
enough to do it competently. In particular, he is not often intelligent
enough to grapple with the fluent and ever-amazing permutations
of a living and rebellious speech. The only way he
can grapple with it at all is by first reducing it to a fixed and formal
organization—in brief, by first killing it and embalming it.
The difference in the resultant proceedings is not unlike that between
a gross dissection and a surgical operation. The difficulties
of the former are quickly mastered by any student of normal
sense, but even the most casual of laparotomies calls for a man of
special skill and address. Thus the elementary study of the national
language, at least in America, is almost monopolized by
dullards. Children are taught it by men and women who observe
it inaccurately and expound it ignorantly. In most other
fields the pedagogue meets a certain corrective competition and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg184"></a>[Pg184]</span>
criticism. The teacher of any branch of applied mathematics,
for example, has practical engineers at his elbow and they quickly
expose and denounce his defects; the college teacher of chemistry,
however limited his equipment, at least has the aid of text-books
written by actual chemists. But English, even in its most
formal shapes, is chiefly taught by those who cannot write it
decently and who get no aid from those who can. One wades
through treatise after treatise on English style by pedagogues
whose own style is atrocious. A Huxley or a Stevenson might
have written one of high merit and utility—but Huxley and
Stevenson had other fish to fry, and so the business was left
to Prof. Balderdash. Consider the standard texts on prosody—vast
piles of meaningless words—hollow babble about spondees,
iambics, trochees and so on—idiotic borrowings from dead languages.
Two poets, Poe and Lanier, blew blasts of fresh air
through that fog, but they had no successors, and it has apparently
closed in again. In the department of prose it lies wholly
unbroken; no first-rate writer of English prose has ever written
a text-book upon the art of writing it.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 2</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Spoken_American_As_It_Is"></a>Spoken American As It Is</h3>—But here I wander afield. The
art of prose has little to do with the stiff and pedantic English
taught in grammar-schools and a great deal less to do with the
loose and lively English spoken by the average American in his
daily traffic. The thing of importance is that the two differ
from each other even more than they differ from the English of
a Huxley or a Stevenson. The school-marm, directed by grammarians,
labors heroically, but all her effort goes for naught.
The young American, like the youngster of any other race, inclines
irresistibly toward the dialect that he hears at home,
and that dialect, with its piquant neologisms, its high disdain
of precedent, its complete lack of self-consciousness, is almost
the antithesis of the hard and stiff speech that is expounded out
of books. It derives its principles, not from the subtle logic <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg185"></a>[Pg185]</span>
of learned and stupid men, but from the rough-and-ready logic
of every day. It has a vocabulary of its own, a syntax of its
own, even a grammar of its own. Its verbs are conjugated in
a way that defies all the injunctions of the grammar books; it
has its contumacious rules of tense, number and case; it has
boldly re-established the double negative, once sound in English;
it admits double comparatives, confusions in person, clipped
infinitives; it lays hands on the vowels, changing them to fit its
obscure but powerful spirit; it disdains all the finer distinctions
between the parts of speech.</div>

<p>This highly virile and defiant dialect, and not the fossilized
English of the school-marm and her books, is the speech of the
Middle American of Joseph Jacobs' composite picture—the mill-hand
in a small city of Indiana, with his five years of common
schooling behind him, his diligent reading of newspapers, and
his proud membership in the Order of Foresters and the Knights
of the Maccabees.<a name="FNanchor_14_311" id="FNanchor_14_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_311" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Go into any part of the country, North,
East, South or West, and you will find multitudes of his brothers—car
conductors in Philadelphia, immigrants of the second
generation in the East Side of New York, iron-workers in the
Pittsburgh region, corner grocers in St. Louis, holders of petty
political jobs in Atlanta and New Orleans, small farmers in
Kansas or Kentucky, house carpenters in Ohio, tinners and
plumbers in Chicago,—genuine Americans all, hot for the home
team, marchers in parades, readers of the yellow newspapers,
fathers of families, sheep on election day, undistinguished norms
of the <i class="abblatin">Homo Americanus</i>. Such typical Americans, after a
fashion, know English. They can read it—all save the "hard"
words, <i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, all save about 90 per cent of the words of Greek and
Latin origin.<a name="FNanchor_15_312" id="FNanchor_15_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_312" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> They can understand perhaps two-thirds of it
as it comes from the lips of a political orator or clergyman.
They have a feeling that it is, in some recondite sense, superior
to the common speech of their kind. They recognize a fluent
command of it as the salient mark of a "smart" and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg186"></a>[Pg186]</span>
"educated" man, one with "the gift of gab." But they themselves
never speak it or try to speak it, nor do they look with approbation
on efforts in that direction by their fellows.</p>

<p>In no other way, indeed, is the failure of popular education
made more vividly manifest. Despite a gigantic effort to enforce
certain speech habits, universally in operation from end
to end of the country, the masses of the people turn almost
unanimously to very different speech habits, nowhere advocated
and seldom so much as even accurately observed. The literary
critic, Francis Hackett, somewhere speaks of "the enormous gap
between the literate and unliterate American." He is apparently
the first to call attention to it. It is the national assumption
that no such gap exists—that all Americans, at least if they
be white, are so outfitted with sagacity in the public schools that
they are competent to consider any public question intelligently
and to follow its discussion with understanding. But the truth
is, of course, that the public school accomplishes no such magic.
The inferior man, in America as elsewhere, remains an inferior
man despite the hard effort made to improve him, and his
thoughts seldom if ever rise above the most elemental concerns.
What lies above not only does not interest him; it actually excites
his derision, and he has coined a unique word, <i>high-brow</i>,
to express his view of it. Especially in speech is he suspicious
of superior pretension. The school-boy of the lower orders would
bring down ridicule upon himself, and perhaps criticism still
more devastating, if he essayed to speak what his teachers conceive
to be correct English, or even correct American, outside
the school-room. On the one hand his companions would laugh
at him as a prig, and on the other hand his parents would probably
cane him as an impertinent critic of their own speech.
Once he has made his farewell to the school-marm, all her diligence
in this department goes for nothing.<a name="FNanchor_16_313" id="FNanchor_16_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_313" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The boys with
whom he plays baseball speak a tongue that is not the one taught
in school, and so do the youths with whom he will begin learning
a trade tomorrow, and the girl he will marry later on, and
the saloon-keepers, star pitchers, vaudeville comedians, business <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg187"></a>[Pg187]</span>
sharpers and political mountebanks he will look up to and try
to imitate all the rest of his life.</p>

<p>So far as I can discover, there has been but one attempt by
a competent authority to determine the special characters of
this general tongue of the <i class="abblatin">mobile vulgus</i>. That authority is Dr.
W. W. Charters, now head of the School of Education at the
University of Illinois. In 1914 Dr. Charters was dean of the
faculty of education and professor of the theory of teaching in
the University of Missouri, and one of the problems he was
engaged upon was that of the teaching of grammar. In the
course of this study he encountered the theory that such instruction
should be confined to the rules habitually violated—that the
one aim of teaching grammar was to correct the speech of the
pupils, and that it was useless to harass them with principles
which they already instinctively observed. Apparently inclining
to this somewhat dubious notion, Dr. Charters applied to
the School Board of Kansas City for permission to undertake
an examination of the language actually used by the children
in the elementary schools of that city, and this permission was
granted. The materials thereupon gathered were of two classes.
First, the teachers of grades III to VII inclusive in all the
Kansas City public-schools were instructed to turn over to Dr.
Charters all the written work of their pupils, "ordinarily done in
the regular order of school work" during a period of four weeks.
Secondly, the teachers of grades II to VII inclusive were instructed
to make note of "all oral errors in grammar made in
the school-room and around the school-building" during the
five school-days of one week, by children of any age, and to dispatch
these notes to Dr. Charters also. The result was an accumulation
of material so huge that it was unworkable with the
means at hand, and so the investigator and his assistants reduced
it. Of the oral reports, two studies were made, the first of
those from grades III and VII and the second of those from
grades VI and VII. Of the written reports, only those from
grades VI and VII of twelve typical schools were examined.</p>

<p>The ages thus covered ran from nine or ten to fourteen or
fifteen, and perhaps five-sixths of the material studied came from <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg188"></a>[Pg188]</span>
children above twelve. Its examination threw a brilliant light
upon the speech actually employed by children near the end
of their schooling in a typical American city, and, <i class="abblatin">per corollary</i>,
upon the speech employed by their parents and other older associates.
If anything, the grammatical and syntactical habits
revealed were a bit less loose than those of the authentic <i
class="abblatin">Volkssprache</i>,
for practically all of the written evidence was gathered
under conditions which naturally caused the writers to try to
write what they conceived to be correct English, and even the
oral evidence was conditioned by the admonitory presence of the
teachers. Moreover, it must be obvious that a child of the lower
classes, during the period of its actual study of grammar, probably
speaks better English than at any time before or afterward,
for it is only then that any positive pressure is exerted upon it
to that end. But even so, the departures from standard usage
that were unearthed were numerous and striking, and their
tendency to accumulate in definite groups showed plainly the
working of general laws.<a name="FNanchor_17_314" id="FNanchor_17_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_314" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Thus, no less than 57 per cent of the oral errors reported by
the teachers of grades III and VII involved the use of the verb,
and nearly half of these, or 24 per cent, of the total, involved
a confusion of the past tense form and the perfect participle.
Again, double negatives constituted 11 per cent of the errors, and
the misuse of adjectives or of adjectival forms for adverbs ran
to 4 per cent. Finally, the difficulties of the objective case
among the pronouns, the last stronghold of that case in English,
were responsible for 7 per cent, thus demonstrating a clear tendency
to get rid of it altogether. Now compare the errors of
these children, half of whom, as I have just said, were in grade
III, and hence wholly uninstructed in formal grammar, with the
errors made by children of the second oral group—that is, children
of grades VI and VII, in both of which grammar is studied.
Dr. Charters' tabulations show scarcely any difference in the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg189"></a>[Pg189]</span>
character and relative rank of the errors discovered. Those in
the use of the verb drop from 57 per cent of the total to 52 per
cent, but the double negatives remain at 7 per cent and the
errors in the case of pronouns at 11 per cent.</p>

<p>In the written work of grades VI and VII, however, certain
changes appear, no doubt because of the special pedagogical effort
against the more salient oral errors. The child, pen in hand,
has in mind the cautions oftenest heard, and so reveals something
of that greater exactness which all of us show when we
do any writing that must bear critical inspection. Thus, the
relative frequency of confusions between the past tense forms
of verbs and the perfect participles drops from 24 per cent to
5 per cent, and errors based on double negatives drop to 1
per cent. But this improvement in one direction merely serves
to unearth new barbarisms in other directions, concealed in the
oral tables by the flood of errors now remedied. It is among
the verbs that they are still most numerous; altogether, the
errors here amount to exactly 50 per cent of the total. Such
locutions as <i>I had went</i> and <i>he seen</i> diminish relatively and absolutely,
but in all other situations the verb is treated with the
lavish freedom that is so characteristic of the American common
speech. Confusions of the past and present tenses jump from
2 per cent to 19 per cent, thus eloquently demonstrating the
tenacity of the error. And mistakes in the forms of nouns and
pronouns increase from 2 per cent to 16: a shining proof of a
shakiness which follows the slightest effort to augment the vocabulary
of everyday.</p>

<p>The materials collected by Dr. Charters and his associates are
not, of course, presented in full, but his numerous specimens
must strike familiar chords in every ear that is alert to the
sounds and ways of the <i class="abblatin">sermo vulgus</i>. What he gathered in
Kansas City might have been gathered just as well in San Francisco,
or New Orleans, or Chicago, or New York, or in Youngstown,
O., or Little Rock, Ark., or Waterloo, Iowa. In each of
these places, large or small, a few localisms might have been
noted—<i>oi</i> substituted for ur in New York, <i>you-all</i> in the South,
a few Germanisms in Pennsylvania and in the upper Mississippi <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg190"></a>[Pg190]</span>
Valley, a few Spanish locutions in the Southwest, certain peculiar
vowel-forms in New England—but in the main the report
would have been identical with the report he makes. That vast
uniformity which marks the people of the United States, in
political doctrine, in social habit, in general information, in reaction
to ideas, in prejudices and enthusiasms, in the veriest details
of domestic custom and dress, is nowhere more marked than
in language. The incessant neologisms of the national speech
sweep the whole country almost instantly, and the iconoclastic
changes which its popular spoken form are undergoing show
themselves from coast to coast. "He hurt <i>his</i>self," cited by Dr.
Charters, is surely anything but a Missouri localism; one hears
it everywhere. And so, too, one hears "she invited <i>him</i> and <i>I</i>,"
and "it hurt <i>terrible</i>," and "I <i>set</i> there," and "this <i>here</i> man,"
and "no, I <i>never, neither</i>", and "he <i>ain't</i> here," and "where is
he <i>at</i>?" and "it seems <i>like</i> I remember," and "if I <i>was</i> you,"
and "<i>us</i> fellows," and "he <i>give</i> her hell." And "he <i>taken</i> and
kissed her," and "he <i>loaned</i> me a dollar," and "the man was
<i>found</i> two dollars," and "the bee <i>stang</i> him," and "I <i>wouldda</i>
thought," and "<i>can</i> I have one?" and "he got <i>hisn</i>," and "the
boss <i>left</i> him off," and "the baby <i>et</i> the soap," and "<i>them</i> are
the kind I like," and "he <i>don't</i> care," and "no one has <i>their</i>
ticket," and "how <i>is</i> the folks?" and "if you would <i>of gotten</i>
in the car you could <i>of rode</i> down."</p>

<p>Curiously enough, this widely dispersed and highly savory
dialect—already, as I shall show, come to a certain grammatical
regularity—has attracted the professional writers of the country
almost as little as it has attracted the philologists. There
are foreshadowings of it in "Huckleberry Finn," in "The Biglow
Papers" and even in the rough humor of the period that
began with J. C. Neal and company and ended with Artemus
Ward and Josh Billings, but in those early days it had not yet
come to full flower; it wanted the influence of the later immigrations
to take on its present character. The enormous dialect
literature of twenty years ago left it almost untouched. Localisms
were explored diligently, but the general dialect went virtually
unobserved. It is not in "Chimmie Fadden"; it is not in <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg191"></a>[Pg191]</span>
"David Harum"; it is not even in the pre-fable stories of George
Ade, perhaps the most acute observer of average, undistinguished
American types, urban and rustic, that American literature has
yet produced. The business of reducing it to print had to wait
for Ring W. Lardner, a Chicago newspaper reporter. In his
grotesque tales of base-ball players, so immediately and so deservedly
successful and now so widely imitated,<a name="FNanchor_18_315" id="FNanchor_18_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_315" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Lardner reports
the common speech not only with humor, but also with the
utmost accuracy. The observations of Charters and his associates
are here reinforced by the sharp ear of one specially competent,
and the result is a mine of authentic American.</p>

<p>In a single story by Lardner, in truth, it is usually possible
to discover examples of almost every logical and grammatical
peculiarity of the emerging language, and he always resists very
stoutly the temptation to overdo the thing. Here, for example,
are a few typical sentences from "The Busher's Honeymoon":<a name="FNanchor_19_316" id="FNanchor_19_316"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_316" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>I and Florrie <i>was</i> married the day before yesterday just <i>like</i> I told
you we <i>was</i> going to be.... You <i>was</i> wise to get married in Bedford,
where <i>not nothing</i> is nearly half so dear.... The sum of what I have
<i>wrote</i> down is $29.40.... Allen told me I <i>should ought</i> to give the

never <i>seen</i> so much wine <i>drank</i> in my life....</div></div>

<p><span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg192"></a>[Pg192]</span></p>

<p>Here are specimens to fit into most of Charters' categories—verbs
confused as to tense, pronouns confused as to case, double
and even triple negatives, nouns and verbs disagreeing in number,
<i>have</i> softened to <i>of</i>, <i>n</i> marking the possessive instead of <i>s</i>,
<i>like</i> used in place of <i>as</i>, and the personal pronoun substituted
for the demonstrative adjective. A study of the whole story
would probably unearth all the remaining errors noted in Kansas
City. Lardner's baseball player, though he has pen in hand
and is on his guard, and is thus very careful to write <i>would not</i>
instead of <i>wouldn't</i> and even <i>am not</i> instead of <i>ain't</i>, offers a
comprehensive and highly instructive panorama of popular
speech habits. To him the forms of the subjunctive mood have
no existence, and <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i> are identical, and adjectives and
adverbs are indistinguishable, and the objective case is merely a
variorum form of the nominative. His past tense is, more often
than not, the orthodox present tense. All fine distinctions are
obliterated in his speech. He uses invariably the word that is
simplest, the grammatical form that is handiest. And so he
moves toward the philological millennium dreamed of by George
T. Lanigan, when "the singular verb shall lie down with the
plural noun, and a little conjugation shall lead them."</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 3</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Verb"></a>The Verb</h3>—A study of the materials amassed by Charters and
Lardner, if it be reinforced by observation of what is heard on
the streets every day, will show that the chief grammatical peculiarities
of spoken American lie among the verbs and pronouns.
The nouns in common use, in the overwhelming main, are quite
sound in form. Very often, of course, they do not belong to
the vocabulary of English, but they at least belong to the vocabulary
of American: the proletariat, setting aside transient slang,
calls things by their proper names, and pronounces those names
more or less correctly. The adjectives, too, are treated rather
politely, and the adverbs, though commonly transformed into
adjectives, are not further mutilated. But the verbs and pronouns
undergo changes which set off the common speech very <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg193"></a>[Pg193]</span>
sharply from both correct English and correct American. Their
grammatical relationships are thoroughly overhauled and sometimes
they are radically modified in form.</div>

<p>This process is natural and inevitable, for it is among the
verbs and pronouns, as we have seen, that the only remaining
grammatical inflections in English, at least of any force or consequence,
are to be found, and so they must bear the chief pressure
of the influences that have been warring upon all inflections
since the earliest days. The primitive Indo-European language,
it is probable, had eight cases of the noun; the oldest known Teutonic
dialect reduced them to six; in Anglo-Saxon they fell to
four, with a weak and moribund instrumental hanging in the
air; in Middle English the dative and accusative began to decay;
in Modern English they have disappeared altogether, save as
ghosts to haunt grammarians. But we still have two plainly
defined conjugations of the verb, and we still inflect it for number,
and, in part, at least, for person. And we yet retain an
objective case of the pronoun, and inflect it for person, number
and gender.</p>

<p>Some of the more familiar conjugations of verbs in the American
common speech, as recorded by Charters or Lardner or derived
from my own collectanea, are here set down:</p>

<p>A glance at these conjugations is sufficient to show several
general tendencies, some of them going back, in their essence,
to the earliest days of the English language. The most obvious
is that leading to the transfer of verbs from the so-called strong
conjugation to the weak—a change already in operation before
the Norman Conquest, and very marked during the Middle English
period. Chaucer used <i>growed</i> for <i>grew</i> in the prologue
to "The Wife of Bath's Tale," and <i>rised</i> for <i>rose</i> and <i>smited</i>
for <i>smote</i> are in John Purvey's edition of the Bible, <i class="abblatin">circa</i> 1385.<a name="FNanchor_40_337" id="FNanchor_40_337"></a><a
href="#Footnote_40_337" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Many of these transformations were afterward abandoned, but
a large number survived, for example, <i>climbed</i> for <i>clomb</i> as the
preterite of <i>to climb</i>, and <i>melted</i> for <i>molt</i> as the preterite of <i>to
melt</i>. Others showed themselves during the early part of the
Modern English period. <i>Comed</i> as the perfect participle of <i>to
come</i> and <i>digged</i> as the preterite of <i>to dig</i> are both in Shakespeare,
and the latter is also in Milton and in the Authorized
Version of the Bible. This tendency went furthest, of course,
in the vulgar speech, and it has been embalmed in the English
dialects. <i>I seen</i> and <i>I knowed</i>, for example, are common to many
of them. But during the seventeenth century it seems to have
been arrested, and even to have given way to a contrary tendency—that
is, toward strong conjugations. The English of Ireland,
which preserves many seventeenth century forms, shows
this plainly. <i>Ped</i> for <i>paid</i>, <i>gother</i> for <i>gathered</i>, and <i>ruz</i> for
<i>raised</i> are still in use there, and Joyce says flatly that the Irish,
"retaining the old English custom [<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, the custom of the period
of Cromwell's invasion, <i class="abblatin">circa</i> 1650], have a leaning toward
the strong inflection."<a name="FNanchor_41_338" id="FNanchor_41_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_338" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Certain verb forms of the American
colonial period, now reduced to the estate of localisms, are also
probably survivors of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>"The three great causes of change in language," says Sayce,
"may be briefly described as (1) imitation or analogy, (2) a wish
to be clear and emphatic, and (3) laziness. Indeed, if we choose
to go deep enough we might reduce all three causes to the general
one of laziness, since it is easier to imitate than to say <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg199"></a>[Pg199]</span>
something new."<a name="FNanchor_42_339" id="FNanchor_42_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_339" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> This tendency to take well-worn paths,
paradoxically enough, is responsible both for the transfer of
verbs from the strong to the weak declension, and for the transfer
of certain others from the weak to the strong. A verb in
everyday use tends almost inevitably to pull less familiar verbs
with it, whether it be strong or weak. Thus <i>fed</i> as the preterite
of <i>to feed</i> and <i>led</i> as the preterite of <i>to lead</i> paved the way for
<i>pled</i> as the preterite of <i>to plead</i>, and <i>rode</i> as plainly performed
the same office for <i>glode</i>, and <i>rung</i> for <i>brung</i>, and <i>drove</i> for <i>dove</i>
and <i>hove</i>, and <i>stole</i> for <i>dole</i>, and <i>won</i> for <i>skun</i>. Moreover, a
familiar verb, itself acquiring a faulty inflection, may fasten
a similar inflection upon another verb of like sound. Thus <i>het</i>,
as the preterite of <i>to heat</i>, no doubt owes its existence to the
example of <i>et</i>, the vulgar preterite of <i>to eat</i>. So far the irregular
verbs. The same combination of laziness and imitativeness
works toward the regularization of certain verbs that are historically
irregular. In addition, of course, there is the fact that
regularization is itself intrinsically simplification—that it makes
the language easier. One sees the antagonistic pull of the two
influences in the case of verbs ending in <i>-ow</i>. The analogy of
<i>knew</i> suggests <i>snew</i> as the preterite of <i>to snow</i>, and it is sometimes
encountered in the American vulgate. But the analogy of
<i>snowed</i> also suggests <i>knowed</i>, and the superior regularity of the
form is enough to overcome the greater influence of <i>knew</i> as a
more familiar word than <i>snowed</i>. Thus <i>snew</i> grows rare and
is in decay, but <i>knowed</i> shows vigor, and so do <i>growed</i> and
<i>throwed</i>. The substitution of <i>heerd</i> for <i>heard</i> also presents a
case of logic and convenience supporting analogy. The form is
suggested by <i>steered</i>, <i>feared</i> and <i>cheered</i>, but its main advantage
lies in the fact that it gets rid of a vowel change, always an impediment
to easy speech. Here, as in the contrary direction, one
barbarism breeds another. Thus <i>taken</i>, as the preterite of <i>to
take</i>, has undoubtedly helped to make preterites of two other
perfects, <i>shaken</i> and <i>forsaken</i>.</p>

<p>But in the presence of two exactly contrary tendencies, the
one in accordance with the general movement of the language <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg200"></a>[Pg200]</span>
since the Norman Conquest and the other opposed to it, it is unsafe,
of course, to attempt any very positive generalizations. All
one may exhibit with safety is a general habit of treating the
verb conveniently. Now and then, disregarding grammatical
tendencies, it is possible to discern what appear to be logical
causes for verb phenomena. That <i>lit</i> is preferred to <i>lighted</i>
and <i>hung</i> to <i>hanged</i> is probably the result of an aversion to fine
distinctions, and perhaps, more fundamentally, to the passive.
Again, the use of <i>found</i> as the preterite of <i>to fine</i> is obviously
due to an ignorant confusion of <i>fine</i> and <i>find</i>, due to the wearing
off of <i>-d</i> in <i>find</i>, and that of <i>lit</i> as the preterite of <i>to alight</i> to a
confusion of <i>alight</i> and <i>light</i>. Yet again, the use of <i>tread</i> as its
own preterite in place of <i>trod</i> is probably the consequence of a
vague feeling that a verb ending with <i>d</i> is already of preterite
form. <i>Shed</i> exhibits the same process. Both are given a logical
standing by such preterites as <i>bled</i>, <i>fed</i>, <i>fled</i>, <i>led</i>, <i>read</i>, <i>dead</i> and
<i>spread</i>. But here, once more, it is hazardous to lay down laws,
for <i>shredded</i>, <i>headed</i>, <i>dreaded</i>, <i>threaded</i> and <i>breaded</i> at once
come to mind. In other cases it is still more difficult to account
for preterites in common use. <i>Drug</i> is wholly illogical, and so
are <i>clum</i> and <i>friz</i>. Neither, fortunately, has yet supplanted the
more intelligible form of its verb, and so it is not necessary to
speculate about them. As for <i>crew</i>, it is archaic English surviving
in American, and it was formed, perhaps, by analogy
with <i>knew</i>, which has succumbed in American to <i>knowed</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the verbs of the vulgate show the end products of
language movements that go back to the Anglo-Saxon period, and
even beyond. There is, for example, the disappearance of the
final <i>t</i> in such words as <i>crep</i>, <i>slep</i>, <i>lep</i>, <i>swep</i> and <i>wep</i>. Most of
these, in Anglo-Saxon, were strong verbs. The preterite of <i>to
sleep</i> (<i>slâepan</i>), for example, was <i>slēp</i>, and that of <i>to weep</i> was
<i>weop</i>. But in the course of time both <i>to sleep</i> and <i>to weep</i> acquired
weak preterite endings, the first becoming <i>slâepte</i> and
the second <i>wepte</i>. This weak conjugation was itself degenerated.
Originally, the inflectional suffix had been <i>-de</i> or <i>-ede</i> and in some
cases <i>-ode</i>, and the vowels were always pronounced. The wearing
down process that set in in the twelfth century disposed <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg201"></a>[Pg201]</span>
of the final <i>e</i>, but in certain words the other vowel survived for
a good while, and we still observe it in such archaisms as <i>belovéd</i>.
Finally, however, it became silent in other preterites, and <i>loved</i>,
for example, began to be pronounced (and often written) as
a word of one syllable: <i>lov'd</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_340" id="FNanchor_43_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_340" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This final <i>d</i>-sound now fell upon
difficulties of its own. After certain consonants it was hard to
pronounce clearly, and so the sonant was changed into the easier
surd, and such words as <i>pushed</i> and <i>clipped</i> became, in ordinary
conversation, <i>pusht</i> and <i>clipt</i>. In other verbs the <i>t</i>-sound had
come in long before, with the degenerated weak ending, and when
the final <i>e</i> was dropped their stem vowels tended to change.
Thus arose such forms as <i>slept</i>. In vulgar American another
step is taken, and the suffix is dropped altogether. Thus, by a
circuitous route, verbs originally strong, and for many centuries
hovering between the two conjugations, have eventually become
strong again.</p>

<p>The case of <i>helt</i> is probably an example of change by false
analogy. During the thirteenth century, according to Sweet,<a name="FNanchor_44_341" id="FNanchor_44_341"></a><a
href="#Footnote_44_341" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
"<i>d</i> was changed to <i>t</i> in the weak preterites of verbs [ending] in
<i>rd</i>, <i>ld</i> and <i>nd</i>." Before that time the preterite of <i>sende</i> (<i>send</i>)
had been <i>sende</i>; now it became <i>sente</i>. It survives in our modern
<i>sent</i>, and the same process is also revealed in <i>built</i>, <i>girt</i>,
<i>lent</i>, <i>rent</i> and <i>bent</i>. The popular speech, disregarding the fact
that <i>to hold</i> is a strong verb, arrives at <i>helt</i> by imitation. In the
case of <i>tole</i>, which I almost always hear in place of <i>told</i>, there
is a leaping of steps. The <i>d</i> is got rid of without any transitional
use of <i>t</i>. So also, perhaps, in <i>swole</i>, which is fast displacing
<i>swelled</i>. <i>Attackted</i> and <i>drownded</i> seem to be examples
of an effort to dispose of harsh combinations by a contrary process.
Both are very old in English. <i>Boughten</i> and <i>dreampt</i> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg202"></a>[Pg202]</span>
present greater difficulties. Lounsbury says that <i>boughten</i> probably
originated in the Northern [<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, Lowland Scotch] dialect
of English, "which ... inclined to retain the full form of the
past participle," and even to add its termination "to words to
which it did not properly belong."<a name="FNanchor_45_342" id="FNanchor_45_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_342" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> I record <i>dreampt</i> without
attempting to account for it. I have repeatedly heard a distinct
<i>p</i>-sound in the word.</p>

<p>The general tendency toward regularization is well exhibited
by the new verbs that come into the language constantly. Practically
all of them show the weak conjugation, for example, <i>to
phone</i>, <i>to bluff</i>, <i>to rubber-neck</i>, <i>to ante</i>, <i>to bunt</i>, <i>to wireless</i>, <i>to
insurge</i> and <i>to loop-the-loop</i>. Even when a compound has as
its last member a verb ordinarily strong, it remains weak itself.
Thus the preterite of <i>to joy-ride</i> is not <i>joy-rode</i>, nor even <i>joy-ridden</i>,
but <i>joy-rided</i>. And thus <i>bust</i>, from <i>burst</i>, is regular
and its preterite is <i>busted</i>, though <i>burst</i> is irregular and its preterite
is the verb itself unchanged. The same tendency toward
regularity is shown by the verbs of the <i>kneel</i>-class. They are
strong in English, but tend to become weak in colloquial American.
Thus the preterite of <i>to kneel</i>, despite the example of <i>to
sleep</i> and its analogues, is not <i>knel'</i>, nor even <i>knelt</i>, but <i>kneeled</i>.
I have even heard <i>feeled</i> as the preterite of <i>to feel</i>, as in "I
<i>feeled</i> my way," though here <i>felt</i> still persists. <i>To spread</i> also
tends to become weak, as in "he <i>spreaded</i> a piece of bread."
And <i>to peep</i> remains so, despite the example of <i>to leap</i>. The
confusion between the inflections of <i>to lie</i> and those of <i>to lay</i>
extends to the higher reaches of spoken American, and so does
that between <i>lend</i> and <i>loan</i>. The proper inflections of <i>to lend</i>
are often given to <i>to loan</i>, and so <i>leaned</i> becomes <i>lent</i>, as in "I
<i>lent</i> on the counter." In the same way <i>to set</i> has almost completely
superseded <i>to sit</i>, and the preterite of the former, <i>set</i>, is
used in place of <i>sat</i>. But the perfect participle (which is also
the disused preterite) of <i>to sit</i> has survived, as in "I have
<i>sat</i> there." <i>To speed</i> and <i>to shoe</i> have become regular, not only
because of the general tendency toward the weak conjugation,
but also for logical reasons. The prevalence of speed contests <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg203"></a>[Pg203]</span>
of various sorts, always to the intense interest of the proletariat,
has brought such words as <i>speeder</i>, <i>speeding</i>, <i>speed-mania</i>, <i>speed-maniac</i>
and <i>speed-limit</i> into daily use, and <i>speeded</i> harmonizes
with them better than the stronger <i>sped</i>. As for <i>shoed</i>, it merely
reveals the virtual disappearance of the verb in its passive form.
An American would never say that his wife was well <i>shod</i>;
he would say that she wore good shoes. <i>To shoe</i> suggests to him
only the shoeing of animals, and so, by way of <i>shoeing</i> and
<i>horse-shoer</i>, he comes to <i>shoed</i>. His misuse of <i>to learn</i> for <i>to
teach</i> is common to most of the English dialects. More peculiar
to his speech is the use of <i>to leave</i> for <i>to let</i>. Charters records
it in "Washington <i>left</i> them have it," and there are many examples
of it in Lardner. <i>Spit</i>, in American, has become invariable;
the old preterite, <i>spat</i>, has completely disappeared. But <i>slit</i>,
which is now invariable in English (though it was strong in
Old English and had both strong and weak preterites in Middle
English), has become regular in American, as in "she <i>slitted</i>
her skirt."</p>

<p>In studying the American verb, of course, it is necessary to
remember always that it is in a state of transition, and that in
many cases the manner of using it is not yet fixed. "The history
of language," says Lounsbury, "when looked at from the purely
grammatical point of view, is little else than the history of corruptions."
What we have before us is a series of corruptions
in active process, and while some of them have gone very far,
others are just beginning. Thus it is not uncommon to find
corrupt forms side by side with orthodox forms, or even two corrupt
forms battling with each other. Lardner, in the case of
<i>to throw</i>, hears "if he had <i>throwed</i>"; my own observation is
that <i>threw</i> is more often used in that situation. Again, he uses
"the rottenest I ever seen <i>gave</i>"; my own belief is that <i>give</i>
is far more commonly used. The conjugation of <i>to give</i>, however,
is yet very uncertain, and so Lardner may report accurately.
I have heard "I <i>given</i>" and "I would of <i>gave</i>," but "I <i>give</i>"
seems to be prevailing, and "I would of <i>give</i>" with it, thus reducing
<i>to give</i> to one invariable form, like those of <i>to cut</i>, <i>to hit</i>,
<i>to put</i>, <i>to cost</i>, <i>to hurt</i> and <i>to spit</i>. My table of verbs shows <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg204"></a>[Pg204]</span>
various other uncertainties and confusions. The preterite of <i>to
hear</i> is <i>heerd</i>; the perfect may be either <i>heerd</i> or <i>heern</i>. That
of <i>to do</i> may be either <i>done</i> or <i>did</i>, with the latter apparently prevailing;
that of <i>to draw</i> is <i>drew</i> if the verb indicates to attract
or to abstract and <i>drawed</i> if it indicates to draw with a pencil.
Similarly, the preterite of <i>to blow</i> may be either <i>blowed</i> or <i>blew</i>,
and that of <i>to drink</i> oscillates between <i>drank</i> and <i>drunk</i>, and
that of <i>to fall</i> is still usually <i>fell</i>, though <i>fallen</i> has appeared,
and that of <i>to shake</i> may be either <i>shaken</i> or <i>shuck</i>. The conjugation
of <i>to win</i> is yet far from fixed. The correct English
preterite, <i>won</i>, is still in use, but against it are arrayed <i>wan</i>
and <i>winned</i>. <i>Wan</i> seems to show some kinship, by ignorant
analogy, with <i>ran</i> and <i>began</i>. It is often used as the perfect
participle, as in "I have <i>wan</i> $4."</p>

<p>The misuse of the perfect participle for the preterite, now
almost the invariable rule in vulgar American, is common to
many other dialects of English, and seems to be a symptom of
a general decay of the perfect tenses. That decay has been going
on for a long time, and in American, the most vigorous and
advanced of all the dialects of the language, it is particularly
well marked. Even in the most pretentious written American it
shows itself. The English, in their writing, still use the future
perfect, albeit somewhat laboriously and self-consciously, but in
America it has virtually disappeared: one often reads whole
books without encountering a single example of it. Even the
present perfect and the past perfect seem to be instinctively
avoided. The Englishman says "I <i>have</i> dined," but the American
says "I <i>am through</i> dinner"; the Englishman says "I <i>had</i>
slept," but the American often says "I <i>was done</i> sleeping."
Thus the perfect tenses are forsaken for the simple present and
the past. In the vulgate a further step is taken, and "I <i>have
been</i> there" becomes "I <i>been</i> there." Even in such phrases as
"he <i>hasn't</i> been here," <i>ain't</i> (=<i>am not</i>) is commonly substituted
for <i>have not</i>, thus giving the present perfect a flavor of
the simple present. The step from "I <i>have taken</i>" to "<i>I taken</i>"
was therefore neither difficult nor unnatural, and once it had
been made the resulting locution was supported by the greater <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg205"></a>[Pg205]</span>
apparent regularity of its verb. Moreover, this perfect participle,
thus put in place of the preterite, was further reinforced
by the fact that it was the adjectival form of the verb, and
hence collaterally familiar. Finally, it was also the authentic
preterite in the passive voice, and although this influence, in
view of the decay of the passive, may not have been of much
consequence, nevertheless it is not to be dismissed as of no consequence
at all.</p>

<p>The contrary substitution of the preterite for the perfect participle,
as in "I have <i>went</i>" and "he has <i>did</i>," apparently has
a double influence behind it. In the first place, there is the
effect of the confused and blundering effort, by an ignorant and
unanalytical speaker, to give the perfect some grammatical differentiation
when he finds himself getting into it—an excursion
not infrequently made necessary by logical exigencies, despite
his inclination to keep out. The nearest indicator at hand is the
disused preterite, and so it is put to use. Sometimes a sense of
its uncouthness seems to linger, and there is a tendency to give
it an <i>en</i>-suffix, thus bringing it into greater harmony with its
tense. I find that <i>boughten</i>, just discussed, is used much oftener
in the perfect than in the simple past tense;<a name="FNanchor_46_343" id="FNanchor_46_343"></a><a
href="#Footnote_46_343" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> for the latter
<i>bought</i> usually suffices. The quick ear of Lardner detects various
other coinages of the same sort, among them <i>tooken</i>, as in
"little Al might of <i>tooken</i> sick."<a name="FNanchor_47_344" id="FNanchor_47_344"></a><a
href="#Footnote_47_344" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> <i>Hadden</i> is also met with,
as in "I would of <i>hadden</i>." But the majority of preterites remain
unchanged. Lardner's baseball player never writes "I
have <i>written</i>" or "I have <i>wroten</i>," but always "I have <i>wrote</i>."
And in the same way he always writes, "I have <i>did</i>, <i>ate</i>, <i>went</i>,
<i>drank</i>, <i>rode</i>, <i>ran</i>, <i>saw</i>, <i>sang</i>, <i>woke</i> and <i>stole</i>." Sometimes the
simple form of the verb persists through all tenses. This is
usually the case, for example, with <i>to give</i>. I have noted "I
<i>give</i>" both as present and as preterite, and "I have <i>give</i>," and
even "I had <i>give</i>." But even here "I have <i>gave</i>" offers rivalry
to "I have <i>give</i>," and usage is not settled. So, too, with <i>to come</i>.
"I have <i>come</i>" and "I have <i>came</i>" seem to be almost equally <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg206"></a>[Pg206]</span>
favored, with the former supported by pedagogical admonition
and the latter by the spirit of the language.</p>

<p>Whatever the true cause of the substitution of the preterite
for the perfect participle, it seems to be a tendency inherent in
English, and during the age of Elizabeth it showed itself even
in the most formal speech. An examination of any play of
Shakespeare's will show many such forms as "I have <i>wrote</i>,"
"I am <i>mistook</i>" and "he has <i>rode</i>." In several cases this transfer
of the preterite has survived. "I have <i>stood</i>," for example,
is now perfectly correct English, but before 1550 the form was
"I have <i>stonden</i>." <i>To hold</i> and <i>to sit</i> belong to the same class;
their original perfect participles were not <i>held</i> and <i>sat</i>, but
<i>holden</i> and <i>sitten</i>. These survived the movement toward the
formalization of the language which began with the eighteenth
century, but scores of other such misplaced preterites were
driven out. One of the last to go was <i>wrote</i>, which persisted
until near the end of the century.<a name="FNanchor_48_345" id="FNanchor_48_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_345" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Paradoxically enough, the
very purists who performed the purging showed a preference
for <i>got</i> (though not for <i>forgot</i>), and it survives in correct English
today in the preterite-present form, as in "I have <i>got</i>,"
whereas in American, both vulgar and polite, the elder and more
regular <i>gotten</i> is often used. In the polite speech <i>gotten</i> indicates
a distinction between a completed action and a continuing
action,—between obtaining and possessing. "I have <i>gotten</i>
what I came for" is correct, and so is "I have <i>got</i> the measles."
In the vulgar speech, much the same distinction exists, but the
perfect becomes a sort of simple tense by the elision of <i>have</i>.
Thus the two sentences change to "I <i>gotten</i> what I come for"
and "I <i>got</i> the measles," the latter being understood, not as
past, but as present.</p>

<p>In "I have <i>got</i> the measles" <i>got</i> is historically a sort of auxiliary
of <i>have</i>, and in colloquial American, as we have seen in
the examples just given, the auxiliary has obliterated the verb.
<i>To have</i>, as an auxiliary, probably because of its intimate relationship
with the perfect tenses, is under heavy pressure, and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg207"></a>[Pg207]</span>
promises to disappear from the situations in which it is still
used. I have heard <i>was</i> used in place of it, as in "before the
Elks <i>was</i> come here."<a name="FNanchor_49_346" id="FNanchor_49_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_346" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Sometimes it is confused ignorantly
with a distinct <i>of</i>, as in "she would <i>of</i> drove," and "I would <i>of</i>
gave." More often it is shaded to a sort of particle, attached to
the verb as an inflection, as in "he would '<i>a</i> tole you," and "who
could '<i>a</i> took it?" But this is not all. Having degenerated to
such forms, it is now employed as a sort of auxiliary to itself, in
the subjunctive, as in "if you had <i>of</i> went," "if it had <i>of</i> been
hard," and "if I had <i>of</i> had."<a name="FNanchor_50_347" id="FNanchor_50_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_347" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> I have encountered some
rather astonishing examples of this doubling of the auxiliary:
one appears in "I wouldn't had '<i>a</i> went." Here, however, the
<i>a</i> may belong partly to <i>had</i> and partly to <i>went</i>; such forms as
<i>a-going</i> are very common in American. But in the other cases,
and in such forms as "I had '<i>a</i> wanted," it clearly belongs to
<i>had</i>. Sometimes for syntactical reasons, the degenerated form
of <i>have</i> is put before <i>had</i> instead of after it, as in "I could <i>of</i>
had her if I had <i>of</i> wanted to."<a name="FNanchor_51_348" id="FNanchor_51_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_348" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Meanwhile, <i>to have</i>, ceasing
to be an auxiliary, becomes a general verb indicating compulsion.
Here it promises to displace <i>must</i>. The American
seldom says "I <i>must</i> go"; he almost invariably says "I <i>have</i>
to go," or "I <i>have got</i> to go," in which last case, as we have
seen, <i>got</i> is the auxiliary.</p>

<p>A study of this paradigm reveals several plain tendencies.
One has just been discussed: the addition of a degenerated form
of <i>have</i> to the preterite of the auxiliary, and its use in place of
the auxiliary itself. Another is the use of <i>will</i> instead of <i>shall</i>
in the first person future. <i>Shall</i> is confined to a sort of optative,
indicating much more than mere intention, and even here
it is yielding to <i>will</i>. Yet another is the consistent use of the
transferred preterite in the passive. Here the rule in correct
English is followed faithfully, though the perfect participle <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg209"></a>[Pg209]</span>
employed is not the English participle. "I am <i>broke</i>" is a
good example. Finally, there is the substitution of <i>was</i> for <i>were</i>
and of <i>am</i> for <i>be</i> in the past and present of the subjunctive. In
this last case American is in accord with the general movement
of English, though somewhat more advanced. <i>Be</i>, in the Shakespearean
form of "where <i>be</i> thy brothers?" was expelled from
the present indicative two hundred years ago, and survives today
only in dialect. And as it thus yielded to <i>are</i> in the indicative,
it now seems destined to yield to <i>am</i> and <i>is</i> in the subjunctive.
It remains, of course, in the future indicative: "I
will <i>be</i>." In American its conjugation coalesces with that of <i>am</i>
in the following manner:</p>

</table>
</div>

<p>All signs of the subjunctive, indeed, seem to be disappearing
from vulgar American. One never hears "if I <i>were</i> you,"
but always "if I <i>was</i> you." In the third person the <i>-s</i> is not
dropped from the verb. One hears, not "if she <i>go</i>," but "if
she <i>goes</i>." "If he <i>be</i> the man" is never heard; it is always
"if he <i>is</i>." This war upon the forms of the subjunctive, of
course, extends to the most formal English. "In Old English,"
says Bradley,<a name="FNanchor_52_349" id="FNanchor_52_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_349" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> "the subjunctive played as important a part as
in modern German, and was used in much the same way. Its
inflection differed in several respects from that of the indicative.
But the only formal trace of the old subjunctive still remaining,
except the use of <i>be</i> and <i>were</i>, is the omission of the final <i>s</i> in
the third person singular. And even this is rapidly dropping
out of use.... Perhaps in another generation the subjunctive
forms will have ceased to exist except in the single instance of
<i>were</i>, which serves a useful function, although we manage to <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg210"></a>[Pg210]</span>
dispense with a corresponding form in other verbs." Here, as
elsewhere, unlettered American usage simply proceeds in advance
of the general movement. <i>Be</i> and the omitted <i>s</i> are already
dispensed with, and even <i>were</i> has been discarded.</p>

<p>In the same way the distinction between <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i>, preserved
in correct English but already breaking down in the
most correct American, has been lost entirely in the American
common speech. <i>Will</i> has displaced <i>shall</i> completely, save in the
imperative. This preference extends to the inflections of both.
<i>Sha'n't</i> is very seldom heard; almost always <i>won't</i> is used instead.
As for <i>should</i>, it is displaced by <i>ought to</i> (degenerated
to <i>oughter</i> or <i>ought'a</i>), and in its negative form by <i>hadn't
ought'a</i>, as in "he <i>hadn't oughter</i> said that," reported by Charters.
Lardner gives various redundant combinations of <i>should</i>
and <i>ought</i>, as in "I don't feel as if I <i>should ought to</i> leave" and
"they <i>should not ought to</i> of had." I have encountered the
same form, but I don't think it is as common as the simple
<i>ought'a</i>-forms. In the main, <i>should</i> is avoided, sometimes at
considerable pains. Often its place is taken by the more positive
<i>don't</i>. Thus "I <i>don't</i> mind" is used instead of "I <i>shouldn't</i>
mind." <i>Don't</i> has also completely displaced <i>doesn't</i>, which is
very seldom heard. "He <i>don't</i>" and "they <i>don't</i>" are practically
universal. In the same way <i>ain't</i> has displaced <i>is not</i>, <i>am
not</i>, <i>isn't</i> and <i>aren't</i>, and even <i>have not</i> and <i>haven't</i>. One recalls
a famous speech in a naval melodrama of twenty years ago:
"We <i>ain't</i> got no manners, but we can fight like hell." Such
forms as "he <i>ain't</i> here," "I <i>ain't</i> the man," "them <i>ain't</i> what
I want" and "I <i>ain't</i> heerd of it" are common.</p>

<p>This extensive use of <i>ain't</i>, of course, is merely a single symptom
of a general disregard of number, obvious throughout the
verbs, and also among the pronouns, as we shall see. Charters
gives many examples, among them, "how <i>is</i> Uncle Wallace and
Aunt Clara?" "you <i>was</i>," "there <i>is</i> six" and the incomparable
"it <i>ain't</i> right to say, 'He <i>ain't</i> here today.'" In Lardner
there are many more, for instance, "them Giants is not such
rotten hitters, <i>is</i> they?" "the people <i>has</i> all wanted to shake
hands with Matthewson and I" and "some of the men <i>has</i> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg211"></a>[Pg211]</span>
brung their wife along." <i>Sez</i> (=<i>says</i>), used as the preterite
of <i>to say</i>, shows the same confusion. One observes it again in
such forms as "then I <i>goes</i> up to him." Here the decay of
number helps in what threatens to become a decay of tense.
Examples of it are not hard to find. The average race-track
follower of the humbler sort seldom says "I <i>won</i> $2," or even "I
<i>wan</i> $2," but almost always "I <i>win</i> $2." And in the same way
he says "I <i>see</i> him come in," not "I <i>saw</i> him" or "<i>seen</i> him."
Charters' materials offers other specimens, among them "we
<i>help</i> distributed the fruit," "she <i>recognize</i>, hug, and <i>kiss</i> him"
and "her father <i>ask</i> her if she intended doing what he <i>ask</i>."
Perhaps the occasional use of <i>eat</i> as the preterite of <i>to eat</i>, as in
"I <i>eat</i> breakfast as soon as I got up," is an example of the
same flattening out of distinctions. Lardner has many specimens,
among them "if Weaver and them had not of <i>begin</i> kicking"
and "they would of <i>knock</i> down the fence." I notice that
<i>used</i>, in <i>used to be</i>, is almost always reduced to simple <i>use</i>, as
in "it <i>use</i> to be the rule." One seldom, if ever, hears a clear <i>d</i>
at the end. Here, of course, the elision of the <i>d</i> is due primarily
to assimilation with the <i>t</i> of <i>to</i>—a second example of one
form of decay aiding another form. But the tenses apparently
tend to crumble without help. I frequently hear whole narratives
in a sort of debased present: "I <i>says</i> to him.... Then
he <i>ups</i> and <i>says</i>.... I <i>land</i> him one on the ear.... He <i>goes</i>
down and out, ..." and so on.<a name="FNanchor_53_350" id="FNanchor_53_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_350" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Still under the spell of our
disintegrating inflections, we are prone to regard the tense inflections
of the verb as absolutely essential, but there are plenty
of languages that get on without them, and even in our own
language children and foreigners often reduce them to a few
simple forms. Some time ago an Italian contractor said to me
"I have <i>go</i> there often." Here one of our few surviving inflections
was displaced by an analytical devise, and yet the man's
meaning was quite clear, and it would be absurd to say that his
sentence violated the inner spirit of English. That inner spirit,
in fact, has inclined steadily toward "I have <i>go</i>" for a thousand
years. <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg212"></a>[Pg212]</span></p>

<p>These inflections, as we shall see, are often disregarded in
use, but nevertheless it is profitable to glance at them as they <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg213"></a>[Pg213]</span>
stand. The only variations that they show from standard English
are the substitution of <i>n</i> for <i>s</i> as the distinguishing mark of
the absolute form of the possessive, and the attempt to differentiate
between the logical and the merely polite plurals in the
second person by adding the usual sign of the plural to the
former. The use of <i>n</i> in place of <i>s</i> is not an American innovation.
It is found in many of the dialects of English, and is, in
fact, historically quite as sound as the use of <i>s</i>. In John Wiclif's
translation of the Bible (<i class="abblatin">circa</i> 1380) the first sentence of the
Sermon on the Mount (Mark v, 3) is made: "Blessed be the
pore in spirit, for the kyngdam in hevenes is <i>heren</i>." And in
his version of Luke xxiv, 24, is this: "And some of <i>ouren</i>
wentin to the grave." Here <i>heren</i>, (or <i>herun</i>) represents, of
course, not the modern <i>hers</i>, but <i>theirs</i>. In Anglo-Saxon the
word was <i>heora</i>, and down to Chaucer's day a modified form of
it, <i>here</i>, was still used in the possessive plural in place of the
modern <i>their</i>, though <i>they</i> had already displaced <i>hie</i> in the
nominative.<a name="FNanchor_54_351" id="FNanchor_54_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_351" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But in John Purvey's revision of the Wiclif
Bible, made a few years later, <i>hern</i> actually occurs in II Kings
viii, 6, thus: "Restore thou to hir alle things that ben <i>hern</i>."
In Anglo-Saxon there had been no distinction between the conjoint
and absolute forms of the possessive pronouns; the simple
genitive sufficed for both uses. But with the decay of that language
the surviving remnants of its grammar began to be put
to service somewhat recklessly, and so there arose a genitive
inflection of this genitive—a true double inflection. In the
Northern dialects of English that inflection was made by simply
adding <i>s</i>, the sign of the possessive. In the Southern dialects
the old <i>n</i>-declension was applied, and so there arose such forms
as <i>minum</i> and <i>eowrum</i> (=<i>mine</i> and <i>yours</i>), from <i>min</i> and
<i>eower</i> (=<i>my</i> and <i>your</i>).<a name="FNanchor_55_352" id="FNanchor_55_352"></a><a
href="#Footnote_55_352" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Meanwhile, the original simple genitive,
now become <i>youre</i>, also survived, and so the literature of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg214"></a>[Pg214]</span>
the fourteenth century shows the three forms flourishing side
by side: <i>youre</i>, <i>youres</i> and <i>youren</i>. All of them are in Chaucer.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>yourn</i>, <i>hern</i>, <i>hisn</i>, <i>ourn</i> and <i>theirn</i>, whatever their present
offense to grammarians, are of a genealogy quite as respectable
as that of <i>yours</i>, <i>hers</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>ours</i> and <i>theirs</i>. Both forms
represent a doubling of inflections, and hence grammatical debasement.
On the side of the <i>yours</i>-form is the standard usage
of the past five hundred years, but on the side of the <i>yourn</i>-form
there is no little force of analogy and logic, as appears on
turning to <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i>. In Anglo-Saxon, as we have seen,
<i>my</i> was <i>min</i>; in the same way <i>thy</i> was <i>thin</i>. During the decadence
of the language the final <i>n</i> was dropped in both cases
before nouns—that is, in the conjoint form—but it was retained
in the absolute form. This usage survives to our own day. One
says "<i>my</i> book," but "the book is <i>mine</i>"; "<i>thy</i> faith," but "I
am <i>thine</i>."<a name="FNanchor_56_353" id="FNanchor_56_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_353" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Also, one says "<i>no</i> matter," but "I have <i>none</i>."
Without question this retention of the <i>n</i> in these pronouns had
something to do with the appearance of the <i>n</i>-declension in the
treatment of <i>your</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>his</i> and <i>our</i>, and, after <i>their</i> had displaced
<i>here</i> in the third person plural, in <i>their</i>. And equally
without question it supports the vulgar American usage today.
What that usage shows is simply the strong popular tendency
to make language as simple and as regular as possible—to abolish
subtleties and exceptions. The difference between "<i>his</i>
book" and "the book is <i>his'n</i>" is exactly that between <i>my</i> and
<i>mine</i>, <i>thy</i> and <i>thine</i>, in the examples just given. "Perhaps it
would have been better," says Bradley, "if the literary language
had accepted <i>hisn</i>, but from some cause it did not do so."<a name="FNanchor_57_354" id="FNanchor_57_354"></a><a
href="#Footnote_57_354" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>As for the addition of <i>s</i> to <i>you</i> in the nominative and objective
of the second person plural, it exhibits no more than an effort
to give clarity to the logical difference between the true
plural and the mere polite plural. In several other dialects of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg215"></a>[Pg215]</span>
English the same desire has given rise to cognate forms, and there
are even secondary devices in American. In the South, for example,
the true plural is commonly indicated by <i>you-all</i>, which,
despite a Northern belief to the contrary, is never used in the
singular by any save the most ignorant.<a name="FNanchor_58_355" id="FNanchor_58_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_355" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> <i>You-all</i>, like <i>yous</i>,
simply means <i>you-jointly</i> as opposed to the <i>you</i> that means <i>thou</i>.
Again, there is the form observed in "you can <i>all of you</i> go to
hell"—another plain effort to differentiate between singular and
plural. The substitution of <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i> goes back to the end
of the thirteenth century. It appeared in late Latin and in the
other continental languages as well as in English, and at about
the same time. In these languages the true singular survives
alongside the transplanted plural, but English has dropped it
entirely, save in its poetical and liturgical forms and in a few
dialects. It passed out of ordinary polite speech before Elizabeth's
day. By that time, indeed, its use had acquired an air
of the offensive, such as it has today, save between intimates or
to children, in Germany. Thus, at the trial of Sir Walter
Raleigh in 1603, Sir Edward Coke, then attorney-general, displayed
his animosity to Raleigh by addressing him as <i>thou</i>, and
finally burst into the contemptuous "I <i>thou</i> thee, <i>thou</i> traitor!"
And in "Twelfth Night" Sir Toby Belch urges Sir Andrew
Aguecheek to provoke the disguised Viola to combat by <i>thouing</i>
her. In our own time, with thou passed out entirely, even as
a pronoun of contempt, the confusion between <i>you</i> in the plural
and <i>you</i> in the singular presents plain difficulties to a man of
limited linguistic resources. He gets around them by setting up
a distinction that is well supported by logic and analogy. "I
seen <i>yous</i>" is clearly separated from "I seen <i>you</i>.". And in the
conjoint position "<i>yous</i> guys" is separated from "<i>you</i> liar."</p>

<p>So much for the personal pronouns. As we shall see, they are
used in such a manner that the distinction between the nominative
and the objective forms, though still existing grammatically,
has begun to break down. But first it may be well to glance at
the demonstrative and relative pronouns. Of the former there <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg216"></a>[Pg216]</span>
are but two in English, <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, with their plural forms,
<i>these</i> and <i>those</i>. To them, American adds a third, <i>them</i>, which
is also the personal pronoun of the third person, objective case.<a name="FNanchor_59_356" id="FNanchor_59_356"></a><a
href="#Footnote_59_356" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
In addition it has adopted certain adverbial pronouns, <i>this-here</i>,
<i>these-here</i>, <i>that-there</i>, <i>those-there</i> and <i>them-there</i>, and set up
inflections of the original demonstratives by analogy with <i>mine</i>,
<i>hisn</i> and <i>yourn</i>, to wit, <i>thisn</i>, <i>thesen</i>, <i>thatn</i> and <i>thosen</i>. I present
some examples of everyday use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div><i>Them</i> are the kind I like.</div>
<div><i>Them</i> men all work here.</div>
<div>Who is <i>this-here</i> Smith I hear about?</div>
<div><i>These-here</i> are mine.</div>
<div><i>That-there</i> medicine ain't no good.</div>
<div><i>Those-there</i> wops has all took to the woods.</div>
<div>I wisht I had one of <i>them-there</i> Fords.</div>
<div><i>Thisn</i> is better'n <i>thatn</i>.</div>
<div>I like <i>thesen</i> better'n <i>thosen</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>The origin of the demonstratives of the <i>thisn</i>-group is plain:
they are degenerate forms of <i>this-one</i>, <i>that-one</i>, etc., just as <i>none</i>
is a degenerate composition form of <i>no(t)-one</i>. In every case
of their use that I have observed the simple demonstratives might
have been set free and <i>one</i> actually substituted for the terminal
<i>n</i>. But it must be equally obvious that they have been reinforced
very greatly by the absolutes of the <i>hisn</i>-group, for in
their relation to the original demonstratives they play the part
of just such absolutes and are never used conjointly. Thus, one
says, in American, "I take <i>thisn</i>" or "<i>thisn</i> is mine," but one
never says "I take <i>thisn</i> hat" or "<i>thisn</i> dog is mine." In this
conjoint situation plain <i>this</i> is always used, and the same rule <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg217"></a>[Pg217]</span>
applies to <i>these</i>, <i>those</i> and <i>that</i>. <i>Them</i>, being a newcomer among
the demonstratives, has not yet acquired an inflection in the
absolute. I have never heard <i>them'n</i>, and it will probably never
come in, for it is forbiddingly clumsy. One says, in American,
both "<i>them</i> are mine" and "<i>them</i> collars are mine."</p>

<p><i>This-here</i>, <i>these-here</i>, <i>that-there</i>, <i>those-there</i> and <i>them-there</i>
are plainly combinations of pronouns and adverbs, and their
function is to support the distinction between proximity, as embodied
in <i>this</i> and <i>these</i>, and remoteness, as embodied in <i>that</i>,
<i>those</i> and <i>them</i>. "<i>This-here</i> coat is mine" simply means "this
coat, <i>here</i>, or this <i>present</i> coat, is mine." But the adverb promises
to coalesce with the pronoun so completely as to obliterate all
sense of its distinct existence, even as a false noun or adjective.
As commonly pronounced, <i>this-here</i> becomes a single word, somewhat
like <i>thish-yur</i>, and <i>these-here</i> becomes <i>these-yur</i>, and <i>that-there</i>
and <i>them-there</i> become <i>that-ere</i> and <i>them-ere</i>. <i>Those-there</i>,
if I observed accurately, is still pronounced more distinctly, but
it, too, may succumb to composition in time. The adverb will
then sink to the estate of a mere inflectional particle, as <i>one</i> has
done in the absolutes of the <i>thisn</i>-group. <i>Them</i>, as a personal
pronoun in the absolute, of course, is commonly pronounced <i>em</i>,
as in "I seen <i>em</i>," and sometimes its vowel is almost lost, but
this is also the case in all save the most exact spoken English.
Sweet and Lounsbury, following the German grammarians, argue
that this <i>em</i> is not really a debased form of <i>them</i>, but the offspring
of <i>hem</i>, which survived as the regular plural of the third
person in the objective case down to the beginning of the fifteenth
century. But in American <i>them</i> is clearly pronounced
as a demonstrative. I have never heard "<i>em</i> men" or "<i>em</i> are
the kind I like," but always "<i>them</i> men" and "<i>them</i> are the
kind I like."</p>

<p>The relative pronouns, so far as I have been able to make out,
are declined as follows:</p>

<div class="verbinflections">
<table summary="relative pronoun inflections">
<tr><td><em>Nominative</em></td>   <td>who</td>   <td>which</td>  <td>what</td>   <td>that</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Possessive&#160;Conjoint</em></td>  <td>whose</td>   <td>whose</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Possessive&#160;Absolute</em></td>  <td>whosen</td>  <td>whosen</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>Objective</em></td>   <td>who</td>   <td>which</td>  <td>what</td>   <td>that</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg218"></a>[Pg218]</span></p>

<p>Two things will be noted in this paradigm. First there is the
disappearance of <i>whom</i> as the objective form of <i>who</i>, and secondly
there is the appearance of an inflected form of <i>whose</i> in
the absolute, by analogy with <i>mine</i>, <i>hisn</i> and <i>thesen</i>. <i>Whom</i>,
as we have seen, is fast disappearing from standard spoken
American;<a name="FNanchor_60_357" id="FNanchor_60_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_357" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> in the vulgar language it is already virtually extinct.
Not only is <i>who</i> used in such constructions as "<i>who</i> did
you find there?" where even standard spoken English would
tolerate it, but also in such constructions as "the man <i>who</i> I
saw," "them <i>who</i> I trust in" and "to <i>who</i>?" Krapp explains
this use of <i>who</i> on the ground that there is a "general feeling,"
due to the normal word-order in English, that "the word which
precedes the verb is the subject word, or at least the subject
form."<a name="FNanchor_61_358" id="FNanchor_61_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_358" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> But this explanation is probably fanciful. Among
the plain people no such "general feeling" for case exists. Their
only "general feeling" is a prejudice against case inflections in
any form whatsoever. They use <i>who</i> in place of <i>whom</i> simply
because they can discern no logical difference between the significance
of the one and the significance of the other.</p>

<p><i>Whosen</i> is obviously the offspring of the other absolutes in <i>n</i>.
In the conjoint relation plain <i>whose</i> is always used, as in "<i>whose</i>
hat is that?" and "the man <i>whose</i> dog bit me." But in the
absolute <i>whosen</i> is often substituted, as in "if it ain't <i>hisn</i>, then
<i>whosen</i> is it?" The imitation is obvious. There is an analogous
form of <i>which</i>, to wit, <i>whichn</i>, resting heavily on <i>which one</i>.
Thus, "<i>whichn</i> do you like?" and "I didn't say <i>whichn</i>" are
plainly variations of "<i>which one</i> do you like?" and "I didn't
say <i>which one</i>." That, as we have seen, has a like form, <i>thatn</i>,
but never, of course, in the relative situation. "I like <i>thatn</i>,"
is familiar, but "the one <i>thatn</i> I like" is never heard. If <i>that</i>,
as a relative, could be used absolutely, I have no doubt that it
would change to <i>thatn</i>, as it does as a demonstrative. So with
<i>what</i>. As things stand, it is sometimes substituted for <i>that</i>,
as in "them's the kind <i>what</i> I like." Joined to <i>but</i> it can also
take the place of <i>that</i> in other situations, as in "I don't know
<i>but what</i>." <span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg219"></a>[Pg219]</span></p>

<p>The substitution of <i>who</i> for <i>whom</i> in the objective case, just
noticed, is typical of a general movement toward breaking down
all case distinctions among the pronouns, where they make their
last stand in English and its dialects. This movement, of course,
is not peculiar to vulgar American; nor is it of recent beginning.
So long ago as the fifteenth century the old clear distinction between
<i>ye</i>, nominative, and <i>you</i>, objective, disappeared, and today
the latter is used in both cases. Sweet says that the phonetic
similarity between <i>ye</i> and <i>thee</i>, the objective form of the true
second singular, was responsible for this confusion.<a name="FNanchor_62_359" id="FNanchor_62_359"></a><a
href="#Footnote_62_359" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> At the
start <i>ye</i> actually went over to the objective case, and the usage
thus established shows itself in such survivors of the period as
<i>harkee</i> (<i>hark ye</i>) and <i>look ye</i>. In modern spoken English, indeed,
<i>you</i> in the objective often has a sound far more like that
of <i>ye</i> than like that of <i>you</i>, as, for example, in "how do y' do?"
and in American its vowel takes the neutral form of the <i>e</i> in
the definite article, and the word becomes a sort of shortened
<i>yuh</i>. But whenever emphasis is laid upon it, <i>you</i> becomes quite
distinct, even in American. In "I mean <i>you</i>," for example,
there is never any chance of mistaking it for <i>ye</i>.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time the other personal pronouns of the
objective case threatened to follow <i>you</i> into the nominative, and
there was a compensatory movement of the nominative pronouns
toward the objective. Lounsbury has collected many examples.<a name="FNanchor_63_360" id="FNanchor_63_360"></a><a
href="#Footnote_63_360" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Marlowe used "is it <i>him</i> you seek?" "'tis <i>her</i> I esteem" and
"nor <i>thee</i> nor <i>them</i>, shall want"; Fletcher used "'tis <i>her</i> I
admire"; Shakespeare himself used "that's <i>me</i>." Contrariwise,
Webster used "what difference is between the duke and <i>I</i>?"
and Greene used "nor earth nor heaven shall part my love and
<i>I</i>." Krapp has unearthed many similar examples from the
Restoration dramatists.<a name="FNanchor_64_361" id="FNanchor_64_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_361" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Etheredge used "'tis <i>them</i>," "it
may be <i>him</i>," "let you and <i>I</i>" and "nor is it <i>me</i>"; Matthew
Prior, in a famous couplet, achieved this: <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg220"></a>[Pg220]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div>For thou art a girl as much brighter than <i>her</i>.<br />
As he was a poet sublimer than <i>me</i>.<br /></div>
</div>

<p>The free exchange continued, in fact, until the eighteenth
century was well advanced; there are examples of it in Addison.
Moreover, it survived, at least in part, even the attack
that was then made upon it by the professors of the new-born
science of English grammar, and to this day "it is <i>me</i>" is still
in more or less good colloquial use. Sweet thinks that it is supported
in such use, though not, of course, grammatically, by the
analogy of the correct "it is <i>he</i>" and "it is <i>she</i>." Lounsbury,
following Dean Alford, says it came into English in imitation
of the French <i>c'est moi</i>, and defends it as at least as good as "it
is <i>I</i>."<a name="FNanchor_65_362" id="FNanchor_65_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_362" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The contrary form, "between you and <i>I</i>," has no defenders,
and is apparently going out. But in the shape of "between
my wife and <i>I</i>" it is seldom challenged, at least in spoken
English.</p>

<p>All these liberties with the personal pronouns, however, fade
to insignificance when put beside the thoroughgoing confusion
of the case forms in vulgar American. "<i>Us</i> fellers" is so far
established in the language that "<i>we</i> fellers," from the mouth
of a car conductor, would seem almost an affectation. So, too,
is "<i>me</i> and <i>her</i> are friends." So, again, are "I seen you and
<i>her</i>," "<i>her</i> and I set down together," "<i>him</i> and his wife," and
"I knowed it was <i>her</i>." Here are some other characteristic
examples of the use of the objective forms in the nominative
from Charters and Lardner:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div><i>Me</i> and <i>her</i> was both late.</div>
<div>His brother is taller than <i>him</i>.</div>
<div>That little boy was <i>me</i>.</div>
<div><i>Us</i> girls went home.</div>
<div>They were John and <i>him</i>.</div>
<div><i>Her</i> and little Al is to stay here.</div>
<div>She says she thinks <i>us</i> and the Allens.</div>
<div>If Weaver and <i>them</i> had not of begin kicking.</div>
<div>But not <i>me</i>.</div>
<div><i>Him</i> and I are friends.</div>
<div><i>Me</i> and <i>them</i> are friends.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg221"></a>[Pg221]</span></p>

<p>Less numerous, but still varied and plentiful, are the substitutions
of nominative forms for objective forms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div>She gave it to mother and <i>I</i>.</div>
<div>She took all of <i>we</i> children.</div>
<div>I want you to meet <i>he</i> and I at 29th street.</div>
<div>He gave <i>he</i> and I both some.</div>
<div>It is going to cost me $6 a week for a room for <i>she</i> and the baby.</div>
<div>Anything she has is O. K. for <i>I</i> and Florrie.</div>
</div>

<p>Here are some grotesque confusions, indeed. Perhaps the best
way to get at the principles underlying them is to examine first,
not the cases of their occurrence, but the cases of their non-occurrence.
Let us begin with the transfer of the objective
form to the nominative in the subject relation. "<i>Me</i> and <i>her</i>
was both late" is obviously sound American; one hears it, or
something like it, on the streets every day. But one never hears
"<i>me</i> was late" or "<i>her</i> was late" or "<i>us</i> was late" or "<i>him</i>
was late" or "<i>them</i> was late." Again, one hears "<i>us</i> girls was
there" but never "<i>us</i> was there." Yet again, one hears "<i>her</i>
and John was married," but never "<i>her</i> was married." The
distinction here set up should be immediately plain. It exactly
parallels that between <i>her</i> and <i>hern</i>, <i>our</i> and <i>ourn</i>, <i>their</i> and
<i>theirn</i>: the tendency, as Sweet says, is "to merge the distinction
of nominative and objective in that of conjoint and absolute."<a name="FNanchor_66_363" id="FNanchor_66_363"></a><a
href="#Footnote_66_363" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
The nominative, in the subject relation, takes the usual nominative
form only when it is in immediate contact with its verb.
If it be separated from its verb by a conjunction or any other
part of speech, even including another pronoun, it takes the
objective form. Thus "<i>me</i> went home" would strike even the
most ignorant shopgirl as "bad grammar," but she would use
"<i>me</i> and my friend went," or "<i>me</i> and <i>him</i>," or "<i>he</i> and <i>her</i>,"
or "<i>me</i> and <i>them</i>" without the slightest hesitation. What is
more, if the separation be effected by a conjunction and another
pronoun, the other pronoun also changes to the objective form,
even though its contact with the verb may be immediate. Thus
one hears "<i>me</i> and <i>her</i> was there," not "<i>me</i> and <i>she</i>"; <i>her</i> and
"<i>him</i> kissed," not "<i>her</i> and <i>he</i>." Still more, this second pronoun <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg222"></a>[Pg222]</span>
commonly undergoes the same inflection even when the
first member of the group is not another pronoun, but a noun.
Thus one hears "John and <i>her</i> were married," not "John and
<i>she</i>." To this rule there is but one exception, and that is in the
case of the first person pronoun, especially in the singular.
"<i>Him</i> and <i>me</i> are friends" is heard often, but "<i>him</i> and <i>I</i> are
friends" is also heard. <i>I</i> seems to suggest the subject very powerfully;
it is actually the subject of perhaps a majority of the
sentences uttered by an ignorant man. At all events, it resists
the rule, at least partially, and may even do so when actually
separated from the verb by another pronoun, itself in the objective
form, as for example, in "<i>I</i> and <i>him</i> were there."</p>

<p>In the predicate relation the pronouns respond to a more
complex regulation. When they follow any form of the simple
verb of being they take the objective form, as in "it's <i>me</i>,"
"it ain't <i>him</i>," and "I am <i>him</i>," probably because the transitiveness
of this verb exerts a greater pull than its function as
a mere copula, and perhaps, too, because the passive naturally
tends to put the speaker in the place of the object. "I seen <i>he</i>"
or "he kissed <i>she</i>" or "he struck <i>I</i>" would seem as ridiculous
to an ignorant American as to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and his instinct for simplicity and regularity naturally tends
to make him reduce all similar expressions, or what seem to him
to be similar expressions, to coincidence with the more seemly
"I seen <i>him</i>." After all, the verb of being is fundamentally
transitive, and, in some ways, the most transitive of all verbs,
and so it is not illogical to bring its powers over the pronoun
into accord with the powers exerted by the others. I incline to
think that it is some such subconscious logic, and not the analogy
of "it is <i>he</i>," as Sweet argues, that has brought "it is <i>me</i>" to
conversational respectability, even among rather careful speakers
of English.<a name="FNanchor_67_364" id="FNanchor_67_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_364" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>But against this use of the objective form in the nominative <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg223"></a>[Pg223]</span>
position after the verb of being there also occurs in American
a use of the nominative form in the objective position, as in
"she gave it to mother and <i>I</i>" and "she took all of <i>we</i> children."
What lies at the bottom of it seems to be a feeling somewhat
resembling that which causes the use of the objective form
before the verb, but exactly contrary in its effects. That is to
say, the nominative form is used when the pronoun is separated
from its governing verb, whether by a noun, a noun-phrase or
another pronoun, as in "she gave it to mother and <i>I</i>," "she took
all of <i>we</i> children" and "he paid her and <i>I</i>" respectively. But
here usage is far from fixed, and one observes variations in both
directions—that is, toward using the correct objective when
the pronoun is detached from the verb, and toward using the
nominative even when it directly follows the verb. "She gave
it to mother and <i>me</i>," "she took all of <i>us</i> children" and "he
paid her and <i>me</i>" would probably sound quite as correct, to a
Knight of Pythias, as the forms just given. And at the other
end Charters and Lardner report such forms as "I want you to
meet <i>he</i> and <i>I</i>" and "it is going to cost me $6 a week for a
room for <i>she</i> and the baby." I have noticed, however, that, in
the overwhelming main, the use of the nominative is confined
to the pronoun of the first person, and particularly to its singular.
Here again we have an example of the powerful way in
which <i>I</i> asserts itself. And superimposed upon that influence
is a cause mentioned by Sweet in discussing "between you and
<i>I</i>."<a name="FNanchor_68_365" id="FNanchor_68_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_365" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> It is a sort of by-product of the pedagogical war upon
"it is <i>me</i>." "As such expressions," he says, "are still denounced
by the grammars, many people try to avoid them in
speech as well as in writing. The result of this reaction is that
the <i>me</i> in such constructions as 'between John and <i>me</i>' and 'he
saw John and <i>me</i>' sounds vulgar and ungrammatical, and is
consequently corrected into <i>I</i>." Here the pedagogues, seeking
to impose an inelastic and illogical grammar upon a living
speech, succeed only in corrupting it still more.</p>

<p>Following <i>than</i> and <i>as</i> the American uses the objective form
of the pronoun, as in "he is taller than <i>me</i>" and "such as <i>her</i>." <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg224"></a>[Pg224]</span>
He also uses it following <i>like</i>, but not when, as often happens,
he uses the word in place of <i>as</i> or <i>as if</i>. Thus he says "do it
like <i>him</i>," but "do it like <i>he</i> does" and "she looks like <i>she</i> was
sick." What appears here is an instinctive feeling that these
words, followed by a pronoun only, are not adverbs, but prepositions,
and that they should have the same power to put the
pronoun into an oblique case that other prepositions have. Just
as "the taller of <i>we</i>" would sound absurd to all of us, so "taller
than <i>he</i>," to the unschooled American, sounds absurd. This
feeling has a good deal of respectable support. "As <i>her</i>" was
used by Swift, "than <i>me</i>" by Burke, and "than <i>whom</i>" by
Milton. The brothers Fowler show that, in some cases, "than
<i>him</i>," is grammatically correct and logically necessary.<a name="FNanchor_69_366" id="FNanchor_69_366"></a><a
href="#Footnote_69_366" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> For
example, compare "I love you more than <i>him</i>" and "I love you
more than <i>he</i>." The first means "I love you more than (I love)
<i>him</i>"; the second, "I love you more than <i>he</i> (loves you)." In
the first <i>him</i> does not refer to <i>I</i>, which is nominative, but to <i>you</i>,
which is objective, and so it is properly objective also. But the
American, of course, uses <i>him</i> even when the preceding noun is
in the nominative, save only when another verb follows the pronoun.
Thus, he says, "I love you better than <i>him</i>," but "I
love you better than <i>he</i> does."</p>

<p>In the matter of the reflexive pronouns the American vulgate
exhibits forms which plainly show that it is the spirit of the
language to regard <i>self</i>, not as an adjective, which it is historically,
but as a noun. This confusion goes back to Anglo-Saxon
days; it originated at a time when both the adjectives
and the nouns were losing their old inflections. Such forms as
<i>Petrussylf</i> (=<i>Peter's self</i>), <i>Cristsylf</i> (=<i>Christ's self</i>) and
<i>Icsylf</i> (=<i>I</i>, <i>self</i>) then came into use, and along with them came
combinations of <i>self</i> and the genitive, still surviving in <i>hisself</i>
and <i>theirselves</i> (or <i>theirself</i>). Down to the sixteenth century
these forms remained in perfectly good usage. "Each for <i>hisself</i>,"
for example, was written by Sir Philip Sidney, and is to
be found in the dramatists of the time, though modern editors
always change it to <i>himself</i>. How the dative pronoun got itself <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg225"></a>[Pg225]</span>
fastened upon <i>self</i> in the third person masculine and neuter is
one of the mysteries of language, but there it is, and so, against
all logic, history and grammatical regularity, <i>himself</i>, <i>themselves</i>
and <i>itself</i> (not <i>its-self</i>) are in favor today. But the
American, as usual, inclines against these illogical exceptions to
the rule set by <i>myself</i>. I constantly hear <i>hisself</i> and <i>theirselves</i>,
as in "he done it <i>hisself</i>" and "they don't know <i>theirselves</i>."
Sometimes <i>theirself</i> is substituted for theirselves, as
in "they all seen it <i>theirself</i>." Also, the emphatic <i>own</i> is often
inserted between the pronoun and the noun, as in "let every
man save his <i>own</i> self."</p>

<p>The American pronoun does not necessarily agree with its
noun in number. I find "I can tell each one what <i>they</i> make,"
"each fellow put <i>their</i> foot on the line," "nobody can do what
<i>they</i> like" and "she was one of <i>these</i> kind of people" in Charters,
and "I am not the kind of man that is always thinking
about <i>their</i> record," "if he was to hit a man in the head ...
<i>they</i> would think <i>their</i> nose tickled" in Lardner. At the bottom
of this error there is a real difficulty: the lack of a pronoun
of the true common gender in English, corresponding to the
French <i>soi</i> and <i>son</i>. <i>His</i>, after a noun or pronoun connoting
both sexes, often sounds inept, and <i>his-or-her</i> is intolerably
clumsy. Thus the inaccurate plural is often substituted. The
brothers Fowler have discovered "anybody else who have only
<i>themselves</i> in view" in Richardson and "everybody is discontented
with <i>their</i> lot" in Disraeli, and Ruskin once wrote "if a
customer wishes you to injure <i>their</i> foot." In spoken American,
even the most careful, <i>they</i> and <i>their</i> often appear; I turn
to the <cite>Congressional Record</cite> at random and in two minutes find
"if anyone will look at the bank statements <i>they</i> will see."<a name="FNanchor_70_367" id="FNanchor_70_367"></a><a
href="#Footnote_70_367" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
In the lower reaches of the language the plural seems to get into
every sentence of any complexity, even when the preceding noun
or pronoun is plainly singular. <span

<p class="ph3number">§ 5</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Adverb"></a>The Adverb</h3>—All the adverbial endings in English, save <i>-ly</i>,
have gradually fallen into decay; it is the only one that is ever
used to form new adverbs. At earlier stages of the language
various other endings were used, and some of them survive in
a few old words, though they are no longer employed in making
new words. The Anglo-Saxon endings were <i>-e</i> and <i>-lice</i>. The
latter was, at first, merely an <i>-e</i>-ending to adjectives in <i>-lic</i>, but
after a time it attained to independence and was attached to
adjectives not ending in <i>-lic</i>. In early Middle English this
<i>-lice</i> changes to <i>-like</i>, and later on to <i>-li</i> and <i>-ly</i>. Meanwhile,
the <i>-e</i>-ending, following the <i>-e</i>-endings of the nouns, adjectives
and verbs, ceased to be pronounced, and so it gradually fell away.
Thus a good many adverbs came to be indistinguishable from
their ancestral adjectives, for example, <i>hard</i> in to <i>pull hard</i>,
<i>loud</i> in <i>to speak loud</i>, and <i>deep</i> in <i>to bury deep</i> (=Anglo-Saxon,
<i>dĕop-e</i>). Worse, not a few adverbs actually became adjectives,
for example, <i>wide</i>, which was originally the Anglo-Saxon adjective
<i>wid</i> (=<i>wide</i>) with the adverbial <i>-e</i>-ending, and <i>late</i>,
which was originally the Anglo-Saxon adjective <i>laet</i> (=<i>slow</i>)
with the same ending.</div>

<p>The result of this movement toward identity in form was a
confusion between the two classes of words, and from the time
of Chaucer down to the eighteenth century one finds innumerable
instances of the use of the simple adjective as an adverb.
"He will answer <i>trewe</i>" is in Sir Thomas More; "and <i>soft</i> unto
himself he sayd" in Chaucer; "the singers sang <i>loud</i>" in the
Revised Version of the Bible (Nehemiah xii, 42), and "<i>indifferent</i>
well" in Shakespeare. Even after the purists of the eighteenth
century began their corrective work this confusion continued.
Thus, one finds, "the people are <i>miserable</i> poor" in
Hume, "how <i>unworthy</i> you treated mankind" in <cite>The Spectator</cite>,
and "<i>wonderful</i> silly" in Joseph Butler. To this day the grammarians
battle with the barbarism, still without complete success;
every new volume of rules and regulations for those who
would speak by the book is full of warnings against it. Among <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg227"></a>[Pg227]</span>
the great masses of the plain people, it goes without saying, it
flourishes unimpeded. The cautions of the school-marm, in a
matter so subtle and so plainly lacking in logic or necessity, are
forgotten as quickly as her prohibition of the double negative,
and thereafter the adjective and the adverb tend more and more
to coalesce in a part of speech which serves the purposes of both,
and is simple and intelligible and satisfying.</p>

<p>Charters gives a number of characteristic examples of its use:
"wounded very <i>bad</i>," "I <i>sure</i> was stiff," "drank out of a cup
<i>easy</i>," "he looked up <i>quick</i>." Many more are in Lardner: "a
chance to see me work <i>regular</i>," "I am glad I was lucky enough
to marry <i>happy</i>," "I beat them <i>easy</i>," and so on. And others
fall upon the ear every day: "he done it <i>proper</i>," "he done
himself <i>proud</i>," "she was dressed <i>neat</i>," "she was <i>awful</i> ugly,"
"the horse ran <i>O. K.</i>," "it <i>near</i> finished him," "it sells <i>quick</i>,"
"I like it <i>fine</i>," "he et <i>hoggish</i>," "she acted <i>mean</i>," "they
keep company <i>steady</i>." The bob-tailed adverb, indeed, enters
into a large number of the commonest coins of vulgar speech.
<i>Near-silk</i>, I daresay, is properly <i>nearly-silk</i>. The grammarians
protest that "run <i>slow</i>" should be "run <i>slowly</i>." But <i>near-silk</i>
and "run <i>slow</i>" remain, and so do "to be in <i>bad</i>," "to play
it up <i>strong</i>" and their brothers. What we have here is simply
an incapacity to distinguish any ponderable difference between
adverb and adjective, and beneath it, perhaps, is the incapacity,
already noticed in dealing with "it is <i>me</i>," to distinguish
between the common verb of being and any other verb.
If "it <i>is</i> bad" is correct, then why should "it <i>leaks</i> bad"
be incorrect? It is just this disdain of purely grammatical
reasons that is at the bottom of most of the phenomena visible
in vulgar American, and the same impulse is observable in all
other languages during periods of inflectional decay. During
the highly inflected stage of a language the parts of speech are
sharply distinct, but when inflections fall off they tend to disappear.
The adverb, being at best the step-child of grammar—as
the old Latin grammarians used to say, "<i class="abblatin">Omnis pars orationis
migrat in adverbium</i>"—is one of the chief victims of this anarchy.
John Horne Tooke, despairing of bringing it to any <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg228"></a>[Pg228]</span>
order, even in the most careful English, called it, in his "Epea
Ptercenta," "the common sink and repository of all heterogeneous
and unknown corruptions."</p>

<p>Where an obvious logical or lexical distinction has grown up
between an adverb and its primary adjective the unschooled
American is very careful to give it its terminal <i>-ly</i>. For example,
he seldom confuses <i>hard</i> and <i>hardly</i>, <i>scarce</i> and <i>scarcely</i>,
<i>real</i> and <i>really</i>. These words convey different ideas. <i>Hard</i>
means unyielding; <i>hardly</i> means barely. <i>Scarce</i> means present
only in small numbers; <i>scarcely</i> is substantially synonymous
with <i>hardly</i>. <i>Real</i> means genuine; <i>really</i> is an assurance of
veracity. So, again, with <i>late</i> and <i>lately</i>. Thus, an American
says "I don't know, <i>scarcely</i>," not "I don't know, <i>scarce</i>"; "he
died <i>lately</i>," not "he died <i>late</i>." But in nearly all such cases
syntax is the preservative, not grammar. These adverbs seem
to keep their tails largely because they are commonly put before
and not after verbs, as in, for example, "I <i>hardly</i> (or <i>scarcely</i>)
know," and "I <i>really</i> mean it." Many other adverbs that take
that position habitually are saved as well, for example, <i>generally</i>,
<i>usually</i>, <i>surely</i>, <i>certainly</i>. But when they follow verbs
they often succumb, as in "I'll do it <i>sure</i>" and "I seen him
<i>recent</i>." And when they modify adjectives they sometimes succumb,
too, as in "it was <i>sure</i> hot." Practically all the adverbs
made of adjectives in <i>-y</i> lose the terminal <i>-ly</i> and thus become
identical with their adjectives. I have never heard <i>mightily</i>
used; it is always <i>mighty</i>, as in "he hit him <i>mighty</i> hard." So
with <i>filthy</i>, <i>dirty</i>, <i>nasty</i>, <i>lowly</i>, <i>naughty</i> and their cognates.
One hears "he acted <i>dirty</i>," "he spoke <i>nasty</i>," "the child behaved
<i>naughty</i>," and so on. Here even standard English has
had to make concessions to euphony. <i>Cleanlily</i> is seldom used;,
<i>cleanly</i> nearly always takes its place. And the use of <i>illy</i> is
confined to pedants.</p>

<p>Vulgar American, like all the higher forms of American and
all save the most precise form of written English, has abandoned
the old inflections of <i>here</i>, <i>there</i> and <i>where</i>, to wit, <i>hither</i>
and <i>hence</i>, <i>thither</i> and <i>thence</i>, <i>whither</i> and <i>whence</i>. These fossil
remains of dead cases are fast disappearing from the language. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg229"></a>[Pg229]</span>
In the case of <i>hither</i> (=<i>to here</i>) even the preposition has been
abandoned. One says, not "I came <i>to here</i>," but simply "I
came <i>here</i>." In the case of <i>hence</i>, however, <i>from here</i> is still
used, and so with <i>from there</i> and <i>from where</i>. Finally, it goes
without saying that the common American tendency to add <i>-s</i>
to such adverbs as <i>towards</i> is carried to full length in the vulgar
language. One constantly hears, not only <i>somewheres</i> and <i>forwards</i>,
but even <i>noways</i> and <i>anyways</i>. Here we have but one
more example of the movement toward uniformity and simplicity.
<i>Anyways</i> is obviously fully supported by <i>sideways</i> and <i>always</i>.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 6</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Noun_and_Adjective"></a>The Noun and Adjective</h3>—The only inflections of the noun remaining
in English are those for number and for the genitive, and
so it is in these two regions that the few variations to be noted
in vulgar American occur. The rule that, in forming the
plurals of compound nouns or noun-phrases, the <i>-s</i> shall be attached
to the principal noun is commonly disregarded, and it
goes at the end. Thus, "I have two <i>sons-in-law</i>" is never heard;
one always hears "I have two <i>son-in-laws</i>." So with the genitive.
I once overheard this: "that umbrella is <i>the young lady
I go with's</i>." Often a false singular is formed from a singular
ending in <i>s</i>, the latter being mistaken for a plural. <i>Chinee</i>,
<i>Portugee</i> and <i>Japanee</i> are familiar; I have also noted <i>trapee</i>,
<i>tactic</i> and <i>summon</i> (from <i>trapeze</i>, <i>tactics</i> and <i>summons</i>). Paradoxically,
the word <i>incidence</i> is commonly misused for <i>incident</i>,
as in "he told an <i>incidence</i>." Here <i>incidence</i> (or <i>incident</i>)
seems to be regarded as a synonym, not for <i>happening</i>, but for
<i>story</i>. I have never heard "he told <i>of</i> an incidence." The <i>of</i>
is always omitted. The general disregard of number often shows
itself when the noun is used as object. I have already quoted
Lardner's "some of the men has brung their <i>wife</i> along"; in
a popular magazine I lately encountered "those book ethnologists ... can't
see what is before their <i>nose</i>." Many similar
examples might be brought forward.</div>

<p>The adjectives are inflected only for comparison, and the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg230"></a>[Pg230]</span>
American commonly uses them correctly, with now and then a
double comparative or superlative to ease his soul. <i>More better</i>
is the commonest of these. It has a good deal of support in logic.
A sick man is reported today to be <i>better</i>. Tomorrow he is further
improved. Is he to be reported <i>better</i> again, or <i>best</i>? The
standard language gets around the difficulty by using <i>still better</i>.
The American vulgate boldly employs <i>more better</i>. In the case
of <i>worse</i>, <i>worser</i> is used, as Charters shows. He also reports
<i>baddest</i>, <i>more queerer</i> and <i>beautifulest</i>. <i>Littler</i>, which he notes,
is still outlawed from standard English, but it has, with <i>littlest</i>,
a respectable place in American. The late Richard Harding
Davis wrote a play called "The <i>Littlest</i> Girl." The American
freely compares adjectives that are incapable of the inflection
logically. Charters reports <i>most principal</i>, and I myself have
heard <i>uniquer</i> and even <i>more uniquer</i>, as in "I have never saw
nothing <i>more uniquer</i>." I have also heard <i>more ultra</i>, <i>more
worse</i>, <i>idealer</i>, <i>liver</i> (that is, <i>more alive</i>), and <i>wellest</i>, as in "he
was the <i>wellest</i> man you ever seen." In general, the <i>-er</i> and
<i>-est</i> terminations are used instead of the <i>more</i> and <i>most</i> prefixes,
as in <i>beautiful</i>, <i>beautifuller</i>, <i>beautifullest</i>. The fact that the
comparative relates to two and the superlative to more than two
is almost always forgotten. I have never heard "the <i>better</i> of
the two," but always "the <i>best</i> of the two." Charters also reports
"the <i>hardest</i> of the two" and "my brother and I measured
and he was the <i>tallest</i>." I have frequently heard "it ain't
so <i>worse</i>," but here a humorous effect seems to have been intended.</p>

<p>Adjectives are made much less rapidly in American than
either substantives or verbs. The only suffix that seems to be in
general use for that purpose is <i>-y</i>, as in <i>tony</i>, <i>classy</i>, <i>daffy</i>, <i>nutty</i>,
<i>dinky</i>, <i>leery</i>, etc. The use of the adjectival prefix <i>super-</i> is confined
to the more sophisticated classes; the plain people seem to
be unaware of it.<a name="FNanchor_71_368" id="FNanchor_71_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_368" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This relative paucity of adjectives appears
to be common to the more primitive varieties of speech. E. J. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg231"></a>[Pg231]</span>
Hills, in his elaborate study of the vocabulary of a child of two,<a name="FNanchor_72_369" id="FNanchor_72_369"></a><a
href="#Footnote_72_369" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
found that it contained but 23 descriptive adjectives, of which
six were the names of colors, as against 59 verbs and 173 common
nouns. Moreover, most of the 23 minus six were adjectives
of all work, such as <i>nasty</i>, <i>funny</i> and <i>nice</i>. Colloquial American
uses the same rubber-stamps of speech. <i>Funny</i> connotes the
whole range of the unusual; <i>hard</i> indicates every shade of difficulty;
<i>nice</i> is everything satisfactory; <i>bully</i> is a superlative of
almost limitless scope.</p>

<p>The decay of <i>one</i> to a vague <i>n</i>-sound, as in <i>this'n</i>, is matched
by a decay of <i>than</i> after comparatives. <i>Earlier than</i> is seldom
if ever heard; composition reduces the two words to <i>earlier'n</i>.
So with <i>better'n</i>, <i>faster'n</i>, <i>hotter'n</i>, <i>deader'n</i>, etc. Once I overheard
the following dialogue: "I like a belt <i>more looser'n</i> what
this one is." "Well, then, why don't you unloosen it <i>more'n</i>
you got it unloosened?"</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 7</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Double_Negative"></a>The Double Negative</h3>—Syntactically, perhaps the chief characteristic
of vulgar American is its sturdy fidelity to the double
negative. So freely is it used, indeed, that the simple negative
appears to be almost abandoned. Such phrases as "I see nobody"
or "I know nothing about it" are heard so seldom that
they appear to be affectations when encountered; the well-nigh
universal forms are "I <i>don't</i> see nobody" and "I <i>don't</i> know
nothing about it." Charters lists some very typical examples,
among them, "he ain't <i>never</i> coming back <i>no</i> more," "you <i>don't</i>
care for nobody but yourself," "couldn't be <i>no</i> more happier"
and "I <i>can't</i> see nothing." In Lardner there are innumerable
examples: "they was <i>not</i> no team," "I have <i>not</i> never thought
of that," "I can't write <i>no</i> more," "no chance to get <i>no</i> money
from <i>nowhere</i>," "we <i>can't</i> have nothing to do," and so on.
Some of his specimens show a considerable complexity, for <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg232"></a>[Pg232]</span>
example, "Matthewson was <i>not</i> only going as far as the coast,"
meaning, as the context shows, that he was going as far as the
coast and no further. <i>Only</i> gets into many other examples, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
"he hadn't <i>only</i> the one pass" and "I don't work nights no
more, <i>only</i> except Sunday nights." This latter I got from a
car conductor. Many other curious specimens are in my collectanea,
among them: "one swaller don't make <i>no</i> summer,"
"I <i>never</i> seen nothing I would of rather saw," and "once a
child gets burnt once it <i>won't</i> never stick its hand in <i>no</i> fire <i>no</i>
more," and so on. The last embodies a triple negative. In
"the more faster you go, the sooner you <i>don't</i> get there" there
is an elaborate muddling of negatives that is very characteristic.</div>

<p>Like most other examples of "bad grammar" encountered
in American the compound negative is of great antiquity and
was once quite respectable. The student of Anglo-Saxon encounters
it constantly. In that language the negative of the
verb was formed by prefixing a particle, <i>ne</i>. Thus, <i>singan</i> (=<i>to
sing</i>) became <i>ne singan</i> (=<i>not to sing</i>). In case the verb began
with a vowel the <i>ne</i> dropped its <i>e</i> and was combined with the
verb, as in <i>naefre</i> (never), from <i>ne-aefre</i> (=<i>not ever</i>). In
case the verb began with an <i>h</i> or a <i>w</i> followed by a vowel, the <i>h</i>
or <i>w</i> of the verb and the <i>e</i> of <i>ne</i> were both dropped, as in <i>naefth</i>
(=<i>has not</i>), from <i>ne-haefth</i> (=<i>not has</i>), and <i>nolde</i> (=<i>would
not</i>), from <i>ne-wolde</i>. Finally, in case the vowel following a <i>w</i>
was an <i>i</i>, it changed to <i>y</i>, as in <i>nyste</i> (=<i>knew not</i>), from <i>ne-wiste</i>.
But inasmuch as Anglo-Saxon was a fully inflected language
the inflections for the negative did not stop with the
verbs; the indefinite article, the indefinite pronoun and even
some of the nouns were also inflected, and survivors of those
forms appear to this day in such words as <i>none</i> and <i>nothing</i>.
Moreover, when an actual inflection was impossible it was the
practise to insert this <i>ne</i> before a word, in the sense of our <i>no</i>
or <i>not</i>. Still more, it came to be the practise to reinforce <i>ne</i>,
before a vowel, with <i>nā</i> (=<i>not</i>) or <i>naht</i> (=<i>nothing</i>), which
later degenerated to <i>nat</i> and <i>not</i>. As a result, there were fearful
and wonderful combinations of negatives, some of them fully
matching the best efforts of Lardner's baseball player. Sweet <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg233"></a>[Pg233]</span>
gives several curious examples.<a name="FNanchor_73_370" id="FNanchor_73_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_370" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> "Nān ne dorste nān thing
āscian," translated literally, becomes "<i>no</i> one dares <i>not</i> ask <i>nothing</i>."
"Thaet hus nā ne feoll" becomes "the house did <i>not</i>
fall <i>not</i>." As for the Middle English "he <i>never</i> nadde <i>nothing</i>,"
it has too modern and familiar a ring to need translating
at all. Chaucer, at the beginning of the period of transition to
Modern English, used the double negative with the utmost freedom.
In "The Knight's Tale" is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div>He <i>nevere</i> yet <i>no</i> vileynye <i>ne</i> sayde<br />
In al his lyf unto <i>no</i> maner wight.<br />
</div></div>

<p>By the time of Shakespeare this license was already much restricted,
but a good many double negatives are nevertheless to
be found in his plays, and he was particularly shaky in the use
of <i>nor</i>. In "Richard III" one finds "I never was <i>nor never</i>
will be"; in "Measure for Measure," "harp not on that <i>nor</i> do
<i>not</i> banish treason," and in "Romeo and Juliet," "thou expectedst
not, <i>nor</i> I looked not for." This misuse of <i>nor</i> is still
very frequent. In other directions, too, the older forms show
a tendency to survive all the assaults of grammarians. "<i>No</i> it
<i>doesn't</i>," heard every day and by no means from the ignorant
only, is a sort of double negative. The insertion of <i>but</i> before
that, as in "I doubt <i>but</i> that" and "there is no question <i>but</i>
that," makes a double negative that is probably full-blown.
Nevertheless, as we have seen, it is heard on the floor of Congress
every day, and the Fowlers show that it is also common in
England.<a name="FNanchor_74_371" id="FNanchor_74_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_371" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Even worse forms get into the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>.
Not long ago, for example, I encountered "without <i>hardly</i> an
exception" in a public paper of the utmost importance.<a name="FNanchor_75_372" id="FNanchor_75_372"></a><a
href="#Footnote_75_372" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> There
are, indeed, situations in which the double negative leaps to the
lips or from the pen almost irresistibly; even such careful writers
as Huxley, Robert Louis Stevenson and Leslie Stephen have <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg234"></a>[Pg234]</span>
occasionally dallied with it.<a name="FNanchor_76_373" id="FNanchor_76_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_373" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It is perfectly allowable in the
Romance languages, and, as we have seen, is almost the rule in
the American vulgate. Now and then some anarchistic student
of the language boldly defends and even advocates it. "The
double negative," said a writer in the <cite>London Review</cite> a long
time ago,<a name="FNanchor_77_374" id="FNanchor_77_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_374" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> "has been abandoned to the great injury of strength
of expression." Surely "I won't take nothing" is stronger
than either "I will take nothing" or "I won't take anything."</p>

<p>"Language begins," says Sayce, "with sentences, not with
single words." In a speech in process of rapid development,
unrestrained by critical analysis, the tendency to sacrifice the
integrity of words to the needs of the complete sentence is especially
marked. One finds it clearly in American. Already we
have examined various assimilation and composition forms:
<i>that'n</i>, <i>use' to</i>, <i>would'a</i>, <i>them 'ere</i> and so on. Many others are observable.
<i>Off'n</i> is a good example; it comes from <i>off of</i> and shows
a preposition decaying to the form of a mere inflectional particle.
One constantly hears "I bought it <i>off'n</i> John." <i>Sort'a</i>, <i>kind'a</i>
and their like follow in the footsteps of <i>would'a</i>. <i>Usen't</i> follows
the analogy of <i>don't</i> and <i>wouldn't</i>. <i>Would 've</i> and <i>should 've</i>
are widely used; Lardner commonly hears them as <i>would of</i> and
<i>should of</i>. The neutral <i>a</i>-particle also appears in other situations,
especially before <i>way</i>, as in <i>that'a way</i> and <i>this'a way</i>.
It is found again in <i>a tall</i>, a liaison form of <i>at all</i>.<a name="FNanchor_78_375" id="FNanchor_78_375"></a><a

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Pronunciation-234"></a>Pronunciation</h3>—Before anything approaching a thorough and
profitable study of the sounds of the American common speech
is possible, there must be a careful assembling of the materials,
and this, unfortunately, still awaits a philologist of sufficient enterprise
and equipment. Dr. William A. Read, of the State
University of Louisiana, has made some excellent examinations <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg235"></a>[Pg235]</span>
of vowel and consonant sounds in the South, Dr. Louise Pound
has done capital work of the same sort in the Middle West,<a name="FNanchor_79_376" id="FNanchor_79_376"></a><a
href="#Footnote_79_376" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
and there have been other regional studies of merit. But most
of these become misleading by reason of their lack of scope;
forms practically universal in the nation are discussed as dialectical
variations. This is the central defect in the work of
the American Dialect Society, otherwise very industrious and
meritorious. It is essaying to study localisms before having first
platted the characteristics of the general speech. The dictionaries
of Americanisms deal with pronunciation only casually,
and often very inaccurately; the remaining literature is meagre
and unsatisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_80_377" id="FNanchor_80_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_377" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Until the matter is gone into at length it
will be impossible to discuss any phase of it with exactness. No
single investigator can examine the speech of the whole country;
for that business a pooling of forces is necessary. But
meanwhile it may be of interest to set forth a few provisional
ideas.</div>

<p>At the start two streams of influence upon American pronunciation
may be noted, the one an inheritance from the English
of the colonists and the other arising spontaneously within the
country, and apparently much colored by immigration. The
first influence, it goes without saying, is gradually dying out.
Consider, for example, the pronunciation of the diphthong <i>oi</i>.
In Middle English it was as in <i>boy</i>, but during the early Modern
English period it was assimilated with that of the <i>i</i> in <i>wine</i>,
and this usage prevailed at the time of the settlement of America.
The colonists thus brought it with them, and at the same
time it lodged in Ireland, where it still prevails. But in England,
during the pedantic eighteenth century, this <i>i</i>-sound was
displaced by the original <i>oi</i>-sound, not by historical research but
by mere deduction from the spelling, and the new pronunciation
soon extended to the polite speech of America. In the common
speech, however, the <i>i</i>-sound persisted, and down to the time of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg236"></a>[Pg236]</span>
the Civil War it was constantly heard in such words as <i>boil</i>,
<i>hoist</i>, <i>oil</i>, <i>join</i>, <i>poison</i> and <i>roil</i>, which thus became <i>bile</i>, <i>hist</i>, <i>ile</i>,
<i>jine</i>, <i>pisen</i> and <i>rile</i>. Since then the school-marm has combatted
it with such vigor that it has begun to disappear, and such forms
as <i>pisen</i>, <i>jine</i>, <i>bile</i> and <i>ile</i> are now very seldom heard, save as
dialectic variations. But in certain other words, perhaps supported
by Irish influence, the <i>i</i>-sound still persists. Chief
among them are <i>hoist</i> and <i>roil</i>. An unlearned American, wishing
to say that he was enraged, never says that he was <i>roiled</i>,
but always that he was <i>riled</i>. Desiring to examine the hoof of
his horse, he never orders the animal to <i>hoist</i> but always to <i>hist</i>.
In the form of <i>booze-hister</i>, the latter is almost in good usage.
I have seen <i>booze-hister</i> thus spelled and obviously to be thus
pronounced, in an editorial article in the <cite>American Issue</cite>, organ
of the Anti-Saloon League of America.<a name="FNanchor_81_378" id="FNanchor_81_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_378" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Various similar misplaced vowels were brought from England
by the colonists and have persisted in America, while dying
out of good England usage. There is, for example, short <i>i</i> in
place of long <i>e</i>, as in <i>critter</i> for <i>creature</i>. <i>Critter</i> is common to
almost all the dialects of English, but American has embedded
the vowel in a word that is met with nowhere else and has thus
become characteristic, to wit, <i>crick</i> for <i>creek</i>. Nor does any
other dialect make such extensive use of <i>slick</i> for <i>sleek</i>. Again,
there is the substitution of the flat <i>a</i> for the broad <i>a</i> in <i>sauce</i>.
England has gone back to the broad <i>a</i>, but in America the flat <i>a</i>
persists, and many Americans who use <i>sassy</i> every day would
scarcely recognize <i>saucy</i> if they heard it. Yet again, there is
<i>quoit</i>. Originally, the English pronounced it <i>quate</i>, but now
they pronounce the diphthong as in <i>doily</i>. In the United States
the <i>quate</i> pronunciation remains. Finally, there is <i>deaf</i>. Its
proper pronunciation, in the England that the colonists left,
was <i>deef</i>, but it now rhymes with <i>Jeff</i>. That new pronunciation
has been adopted by polite American, despite the protests
of Noah Webster, but in the common speech the word is still
always <i>deef</i>.</p>

<p>However, a good many of the vowels of the early days have <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg237"></a>[Pg237]</span>
succumbed to pedagogy. The American proletarian may still
use <i>skeer</i> for <i>scare</i>, but in most of the other words of that class
he now uses the vowel approved by correct English usage. Thus
he seldom permits himself such old forms as <i>dreen</i> for <i>drain</i>,
<i>keer</i> for <i>care</i>, <i>skeerce</i> for <i>scarce</i> or even <i>cheer</i> for <i>chair</i>. The
Irish influence supported them for a while, but now they are
fast going out. So, too, are <i>kivver</i> for <i>cover</i>, <i>crap</i> for <i>crop</i>,
and <i>chist</i> for <i>chest</i>. But <i>kittle</i> for <i>kettle</i> still shows a certain
vitality, <i>rench</i> is still used in place of <i>rinse</i>, and <i>squinch</i> in place
of <i>squint</i>, and a flat <i>a</i> continues to displace various <i>e</i>-sounds in
such words as <i>rare</i> for <i>rear</i> (<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, as a horse) and <i>wrassle</i> for
<i>wrestle</i>. Contrariwise, <i>e</i> displaces <i>a</i> in <i>catch</i> and <i>radish</i>, which
are commonly pronounced <i>ketch</i> and <i>reddish</i>. This <i>e</i>-sound was
once accepted in standard English; when it got into spoken
American it was perfectly sound; one still hears it from the most
pedantic lips in <i>any</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82_379" id="FNanchor_82_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_379" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> There are also certain other ancients
that show equally unbroken vitality among us, for example,
<i>stomp</i> for <i>stamp</i>,<a name="FNanchor_83_380" id="FNanchor_83_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_380" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> <i>snoot</i> for <i>snout</i>, <i>guardeen</i> for <i>guardian</i>, and
<i>champeen</i> for <i>champion</i>.</p>

<p>But all these vowels, whether approved or disapproved, have
been under the pressure, for the past century, of a movement
toward a general vowel neutralization, and in the long run it
promises to dispose of many of them. The same movement also
affects standard English, as appears by Robert Bridges' "Tract
on the Present State of English Pronunciation," but I believe
that it is stronger in America, and will go farther, at least with
the common speech, if only because of our unparalleled immigration.
Standard English has 19 separate vowel sounds. No
other living tongue of Europe, save Portuguese, has so many;
most of the others have a good many less; Modern Greek has
but five. The immigrant, facing all these vowels, finds some
of them quite impossible; the Russian Jew, as we have seen,
cannot manage <i>ur</i>. As a result, he tends to employ a neutralized <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg238"></a>[Pg238]</span>
vowel in all the situations which present difficulties, and this
neutralized vowel, supported by the slip-shod speech-habits of
the native proletariat, makes steady progress. It appears in
many of the forms that we have been examining—in the final <i>a</i>
of <i>would'a</i>, vaguely before the <i>n</i> in <i>this'n</i> and <i>off'n</i>, in place of
the original <i>d</i> in <i>use' to</i>, and in the common pronunciation of
such words as <i>been</i>, <i>come</i> and <i>have</i>, particularly when they are
sacrificed to sentence exigencies, as in "I <i>b'n</i> thinking," "<i>c'm
'ere</i>," and "he would <i>'ve</i> saw you."</p>

<p>Here we are upon a wearing down process that shows many
other symptoms. One finds, not only vowels disorganized, but
also consonants. Some are displaced by other consonants, measurably
more facile; others are dropped altogether. <i>D</i> becomes <i>t</i>,
as in <i>holt</i>, or is dropped, as in <i>tole</i>, <i>han'kerchief</i>, <i>bran-new</i> and
<i>fine</i> (for <i>find</i>). In <i>ast</i> (for <i>ask</i>) <i>t</i> replaces <i>k</i>: when the same
word is used in place of <i>asked</i>, as often happens, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, in "I <i>ast</i>
him his name," it shoulders out <i>ked</i>. It is itself lopped off in
<i>bankrup</i>, <i>quan'ity</i>, <i>crep</i>, <i>slep</i>, <i>wep</i>, <i>kep</i>, <i>gris'-mill</i> and <i>les</i>
(=<i>let's</i> = <i>let us</i>), and is replaced by <i>d</i> in <i>kindergarden</i> and
<i>pardner</i>. <i>L</i> disappears, as in <i>a'ready</i> and <i>gent'man</i>. <i>S</i> becomes
<i>tsh</i>, as in <i>pincers</i>. The same <i>tsh</i> replaces <i>c</i>, as in <i>pitcher</i> for
<i>picture</i>, and <i>t</i>, as in <i>amachoor</i>. <i>G</i> disappears from the ends of
words, and sometimes, too, in the middle, as in <i>stren'th</i> and
<i>reco'nize</i>. <i>R</i>, though it is better preserved in American than
in English, is also under pressure, as appears by <i>bust</i>, <i>stuck on</i>
(for <i>struck on</i>), <i>cuss</i> (for <i>curse</i>), <i>yestiddy</i>, <i>sa's'parella</i>, <i>pa'tridge</i>,
<i>ca'tridge</i>, <i>they is</i> (for <i>there is</i>) and <i>Sadd'y</i> (for <i>Saturday</i>).
An excrescent <i>t</i> survives in a number of words, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>onc't</i>, <i>twic't</i>, <i>clos't</i>, <i>wisht</i> (for <i>wish</i>) and <i>chanc't</i>; it is an heirloom
from the English of two centuries ago. So is the final <i>h</i>
in <i>heighth</i>. An excrescent <i>b</i>, as in <i>chimbley</i> and <i>fambly</i>, seems
to be native. Whole syllables are dropped out of words, paralleling
the English butchery of <i>extraordinary</i>; for example, in
<i>bound'ry</i>, <i>hist'ry</i>, <i>lib'ry</i> and <i>prob'ly</i>. <i>Ordinary</i>, like <i>extraordinary</i>,
is commonly enunciated clearly, but it has bred a degenerated
form, <i>onry</i> or <i>onery</i>, differentiated in meaning. Consonants
are misplaced by metathesis, as in <i>prespiration</i>, <i>hunderd</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg239"></a>[Pg239]</span>
<i>brethern</i>, <i>childern</i>, <i>interduce</i>, <i>apern</i>, <i>calvary</i>, <i>govrenment</i>,
<i>modren</i> and <i>wosterd</i> (for <i>worsted</i>). <i>Ow</i> is changed to <i>er</i>, as in
<i>feller</i>, <i>swaller</i>, <i>yeller</i>, <i>beller</i>, <i>umbreller</i> and <i>holler</i>; <i>ice</i> is changed
to <i>ers</i> in <i>jaunders</i>. Words are given new syllables, as in <i>ellum</i>,
<i>mischievious</i> and <i>municipial</i>.</p>

<p>In the complete sentence, assimilation makes this disorganization
much more obvious. Mearns, in a brief article<a name="FNanchor_84_381" id="FNanchor_84_381"></a><a
href="#Footnote_84_381" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> gives many
examples of the extent to which it is carried. He hears "wah
zee say?" for "what does he say?" "ware zee?" for "where
is he?" "ast 'er in" for "ask her in," "itt'm owd" for "hit
them out," "sry" for "that is right," and "c'meer" for "come
here." He believes that <i>t</i> is gradually succumbing to <i>d</i>, and
cites "ass bedder" (for "that's better"), "wen juh ged din?"
(for "when did you get in?"), and "siddup" (for "sit up").
One hears countless other such decayed forms on the street every
day. <i>Have to</i> is almost invariably made <i>hafta</i>, with the neutral
vowel where I have put the second <i>a</i>. <i>Let's</i>, already noticed, is
<i>le' 's</i>. The neutral vowel replaces the <i>oo</i> of <i>good</i> in <i>g'by</i>.
"What did you say" reduces itself to "wuz ay?" <i>Maybe</i> is
<i>mebby</i>, <i>perhaps</i> is <i>p'raps</i>, <i>so long</i> is <i>s'long</i>, <i>excuse me</i> is <i>skus me</i>;
the common salutation, "How are you?" is so dismembered that
it finally emerges as a word almost indistinguishable from <i>high</i>.
Here there is room for inquiry, and that inquiry deserves the
best effort of American phonologists, for the language is undergoing
rapid changes under their very eyes, or, perhaps more
accurately, under their very ears, and a study of those changes
should yield a great deal of interesting matter. How did the
word <i>stint</i>, on American lips, first convert itself into <i>stent</i> and
then into <i>stunt</i>? By what process was <i>baulk</i> changed into <i>buck</i>?
Both <i>stunt</i> and <i>buck</i> are among the commonest words in the
everyday American vocabulary, and yet no one, so far, has investigated
them scientifically.</p>

<p>A by-way that is yet to be so much as entered is that of naturalized
loan-words in the common speech. A very characteristic
word of that sort is <i>sashay</i>. Its relationship to the French
<i>chassé</i> seems to be plain, and yet it has acquired meanings in <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg240"></a>[Pg240]</span>
American that differ very widely from the meaning of <i>chassé</i>.
How widely it is dispersed may be seen by the fact that it is reported
in popular use, as a verb signifying to prance or to walk
consciously, in Southeastern Missouri, Nebraska, Northwestern
Arkansas, Eastern Alabama and Western Indiana, and, with
slightly different meaning, on Cape Cod. The travels of <i>café</i>
in America would repay investigation; particularly its variations
in pronunciation. I believe that it is fast becoming <i>kaif</i>.
<i>Plaza</i>, <i>boulevard</i>, <i>vaudeville</i>, <i>menu</i> and <i>rathskeller</i> have entered
into the common speech of the land, and are pronounced as American
words. Such words, when they come in verbally, by actual
contact with immigrants, commonly retain some measure of their
correct native pronunciation. <i>Spiel</i>, <i>kosher</i>, <i>ganof</i> and <i>matzoh</i>
are examples; their vowels remain un-American. But words
that come in visually, say through street-signs and the newspapers,
are immediately overhauled and have thoroughly Americanized
vowels and consonants thereafter. School-teachers have
been trying to establish various pseudo-French pronunciations
of <i>vase</i> for fifty years past, but it still rhymes with <i>face</i> in the
vulgate. <i>Vaudeville</i> is <i>vawd-vill</i>; <i>boulevard</i> has a hard <i>d</i> at the
end; <i>plaza</i> has two flat <i>a</i>'s; the first syllable of <i>menu</i> rhymes
with <i>bee</i>; the first of <i>rathskeller</i> with <i>cats</i>; <i>fiancée</i> is <i>fy-ancé-y</i>;
<i>née</i> rhymes with <i>see</i>; <i>décolleté</i> is <i>de-coll-ty</i>; <i>hofbräu</i> is <i>huffbrow</i>;
the German <i>w</i> has lost its <i>v</i>-sound and becomes an American <i>w</i>.
I have, in my day, heard <i>proteege</i> for <i>protégé</i>, <i>habichoo</i> for
<i>habitué</i>, <i>connisoor</i> for <i>connisseur</i>, <i>shirtso</i> for <i>scherzo</i>, <i>premeer</i>
for <i>première</i>, <i>eetood</i> for <i>étude</i> and <i>prelood</i> for <i>prelude</i>. <i>Divorcée</i>
is <i>divorcey</i>, and has all the rakishness of the adjectives in <i>-y</i>.
The first syllable of <i>mayonnaise</i> rhymes with <i>hay</i>. <i>Crème de
menthe</i> is <i>cream de mint</i>. <i>Schweizer</i> is <i>swite-ser</i>. <i>Rochefort</i> is
<i>roke-fort</i>. I have heard <i>début</i> with the last syllable rhyming
with <i>nut</i>. I have heard <i>minoot</i> for <i>minuet</i>. I have heard <i>tchef
doover</i> for <i>chef d'œuvre</i>. And who doesn't remember</p>

means in all. The Irish influence probably had something to do with
its prosperity in vulgar American. At all events, the Irish use it in the
American manner. Joyce, in English As We Speak It in Ireland, pp. 34-5,
argues that this usage was suggested by Gaelic. In Gaelic the accusative
pronouns, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i> and <i>iad</i> (=<i>him</i>, <i>her</i> and <i>them</i>) are often used in place of
the nominatives, <i>sé</i>, <i>si</i> and <i>siad</i> (=<i>he</i>, <i>she</i> and <i>they</i>), as in "is <i>iad</i> sin na
buachaillidhe" (=<i>them</i> are the boys). This is "good grammar" in Gaelic,
and the Irish, when they began to learn English, translated the locution
literally. The familiar Irish "John is dead and <i>him</i> always so hearty"
shows the same influence.</p></div>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="General_Tendencies"></a>General Tendencies</h3>—This list is by no means exhaustive.
According to a recent writer upon the subject, "there are 812
words in which the prevailing American spelling differs from
the English."<a name="FNanchor_2_383" id="FNanchor_2_383"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2_383" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
But enough examples are given to reveal a
number of definite tendencies. American, in general, moves toward
simplified forms of spelling more rapidly than English,
and has got much further along the road. Redundant and unnecessary
letters have been dropped from whole groups of words—the
<i>u</i> from the group of nouns in <i>-our</i>, with the sole exception
of <i>Saviour</i>, and from such words as <i>mould</i> and <i>baulk</i>; the <i>e</i> from
<i>annexe</i>, <i>asphalte</i>, <i>axe</i>, <i>forme</i>, <i>pease</i>, <i>storey</i>, etc.; the duplicate
consonant from <i>waggon</i>, <i>nett</i>, <i>faggot</i>, <i>woollen</i>, <i>jeweller</i>, <i>councillor</i>,
etc., and the silent foreign suffixes from <i>toilette</i>, <i>epaulette</i>,
<i>programme</i>, <i>verandah</i>, etc. In addition, simple vowels have been
substituted for degenerated diphthongs in such words as <i>anaemia</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg246"></a>[Pg246]</span>
<i>oesophagus</i>, <i>diarrhoea</i> and <i>mediaeval</i>, most of them from the
Greek.</div>

<p>Further attempts in the same direction are to be seen in the
substitution of simple consonants for compound consonants, as
in <i>plow</i>, <i>bark</i>, <i>check</i>, <i>vial</i> and <i>draft</i>; in the substitution of <i>i</i> for <i>y</i>
to bring words into harmony with analogues, as in <i>tire</i>, <i>cider</i>
and <i>baritone</i> (<i class="abblatin">cf.</i> <i>wire</i>, <i>rider</i>, <i>merriment</i>), and in the general
tendency to get rid of the somewhat uneuphonious <i>y</i>, as in <i>ataxia</i>
and <i>pajamas</i>. Clarity and simplicity are also served by substituting
<i>ct</i> for <i>x</i> in such words as <i>connection</i> and <i>inflection</i>, and
<i>s</i> for <i>c</i> in words of the <i>defense</i> group. The superiority of <i>jail</i>
to <i>gaol</i> is made manifest by the common mispronunciation of the
latter, making it rhyme with <i>coal</i>. The substitution of <i>i</i> for <i>e</i>
in such words as <i>indorse</i>, <i>inclose</i> and <i>jimmy</i> is of less patent
utility, but even here there is probably a slight gain in euphony.
Of more obscure origin is what seems to be a tendency to avoid
the <i>o</i>-sound, so that the English <i>slog</i> becomes <i>slug</i>, <i>podgy</i> becomes
<i>pudgy</i>, <i>nought</i> becomes <i>naught</i>, <i>slosh</i> becomes <i>slush</i>, <i>toffy</i> becomes
<i>taffy</i>, and so on. Other changes carry their own justification.
<i>Hostler</i> is obviously better American than <i>ostler</i>, though
it may be worse English. <i>Show</i> is more logical than <i>shew</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_384" id="FNanchor_3_384"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_384" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<i>Cozy</i> is more nearly phonetic than <i>cosy</i>. <i>Curb</i> has analogues in
<i>curtain</i>, <i>curdle</i>, <i>curfew</i>, <i>curl</i>, <i>currant</i>, <i>curry</i>, <i>curve</i>, <i>curtsey</i>,
<i>curse</i>, <i>currency</i>, <i>cursory</i>, <i>curtail</i>, <i>cur</i>, <i>curt</i> and many other common
words: <i>kerb</i> has very few, and of them only <i>kerchief</i> and
<i>kernel</i> are in general use. Moreover, the English themselves
use <i>curb</i> as a verb and in all noun senses save that shown in
<i>kerbstone</i>.</p>

<p>But a number of anomalies remain. The American substitution
of <i>a</i> for <i>e</i> in <i>gray</i> is not easily explained, nor is the substitution
of <i>k</i> for <i>c</i> in <i>skeptic</i> and <i>mollusk</i>, nor the retention of
<i>e</i> in <i>forego</i>, nor the unphonetic substitution of <i>s</i> for <i>z</i> in <i>fuse</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg247"></a>[Pg247]</span>
nor the persistence of the first <i>y</i> in <i>pygmy</i>. Here we have plain
vagaries, surviving in spite of attack by orthographers. Webster,
in one of his earlier books, denounced the <i>k</i> in <i>skeptic</i> as
"a mere pedantry," but later on he adopted it. In the same
way <i>pygmy</i>, <i>gray</i> and <i>mollusk</i> have been attacked, but they still
remain sound American. The English themselves have many
more such illogical forms to account for. In the midst of the
<i>our</i>-words they cling to a small number in <i>or</i>, among them,
<i>stupor</i>. Moreover, they drop the <i>u</i> in many derivatives, for
example, in <i>arboreal</i>, <i>armory</i>, <i>clamorously</i>, <i>clangorous</i>, <i>odoriferous</i>,
<i>humorist</i>, <i>laborious</i> and <i>rigorism</i>. If it were dropped in
all derivatives the rule would be easy to remember, but it is retained
in some of them, for example, <i>colourable</i>, <i>favourite</i>, <i>misdemeanour</i>,
<i>coloured</i> and <i>labourer</i>. The derivatives of <i>honour</i>
exhibit the confusion clearly. <i>Honorary</i>, <i>honorarium</i> and <i>honorific</i>
drop the <i>u</i>, but <i>honourable</i> retains it. Furthermore, the
English make a distinction between two senses of <i>rigor</i>. When
used in its pathological sense (not only in the Latin form of
<i>rigor mortis</i>, but as an English word) it drops the <i>u</i>; in all other
senses it retains the <i>u</i>. The one American anomaly in this field
is <i>Saviour</i>. In its theological sense it retains the <i>u</i>; but in that
sense only. A sailor who saves his ship is its <i>savior</i>, not its
<i>saviour</i>.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 3</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Influence_of_Webster"></a>The Influence of Webster</h3>—At the time of the first settlement
of America the rules of English orthography were beautifully
vague, and so we find the early documents full of spellings that
would give an English lexicographer much pain today. Now
and then a curious foreshadowing of later American usage is
encountered. On July 4, 1631, for example, John Winthrop
wrote in his journal that "the governour built a <i>bark</i> at Mistick,
which was launched this day." But during the eighteenth century,
and especially after the publication of Johnson's dictionary,
there was a general movement in England toward a more
inflexible orthography, and many hard and fast rules, still surviving,
were then laid down. It was Johnson himself who <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg248"></a>[Pg248]</span>
established the position of the <i>u</i> in the <i>our</i> words. Bailey, Dyche
and the other lexicographers before him were divided and uncertain;
Johnson declared for the <i>u</i>, and though his reasons were
very shaky<a name="FNanchor_4_385" id="FNanchor_4_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_385" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and he often neglected his own precept, his authority
was sufficient to set up a usage which still defies attack in
England. Even in America this usage was not often brought
into question until the last quarter of the eighteenth century.
True enough, <i>honor</i> appears in the Declaration of Independence,
but it seems to have got there rather by accident than by design.
In Jefferson's original draft it is spelled <i>honour</i>. So early as
1768 Benjamin Franklin had published his "Scheme for a New
Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling, with Remarks and
Examples Concerning the Same, and an Enquiry Into its Uses"
and induced a Philadelphia typefounder to cut type for it, but
this scheme was too extravagant to be adopted anywhere, or to
have any appreciable influence upon spelling.<a name="FNanchor_5_386" id="FNanchor_5_386"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5_386" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></div>

<p>It was Noah Webster who finally achieved the divorce between
English example and American practise. He struck the first
blow in his "Grammatical Institute of the English Language,"
published at Hartford in 1783. Attached to this work was an
appendix bearing the formidable title of "An Essay on the
Necessity, Advantages and Practicability of Reforming the
Mode of Spelling, and of Rendering the Orthography of Words
Correspondent to the Pronunciation," and during the same
year, at Boston, he set forth his ideas a second time in the first
edition of his "American Spelling Book." The influence of this
spelling book was immediate and profound. It took the place
in the schools of Dilworth's "Aby-sel-pha," the favorite of the
generation preceding, and maintained its authority for fully a
century. Until Lyman Cobb entered the lists with his "New
Spelling Book," in 1842, its innumerable editions scarcely had <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg249"></a>[Pg249]</span>
any rivalry, and even then it held its own. I have a New York
edition, dated 1848, which contains an advertisement stating
that the annual sale at that time was more than a million copies,
and that more than 30,000,000 copies had been sold since 1783.
In the late 40's the publishers, George F. Cooledge &#38; Bro., devoted
the whole capacity of the fastest steam press in the United
States to the printing of it. This press turned out 525 copies
an hour, or 5,250 a day. It was "constructed expressly for
printing Webster's Elementary Spelling Book [the name had
been changed in 1829] at an expense of $5,000." Down to
1889, 62,000,000 copies of the book had been sold.</p>

<p>The appearance of Webster's first dictionary, in 1806, greatly
strengthened his influence. The best dictionary available to
Americans before this was Johnson's in its various incarnations,
but against Johnson's stood a good deal of animosity to its compiler,
whose implacable hatred of all things American was well
known to the citizens of the new republic. John Walker's dictionary,
issued in London in 1791, was also in use, but not extensively.
A home-made school dictionary, issued at New Haven
in 1798 or 1799 by one Samuel Johnson, Jr.—apparently no
relative of the great Sam—and a larger work published a year
later by Johnson and the Rev. John Elliott, pastor in East Guilford,
Conn., seem to have made no impression, despite the fact
that the latter was commended by Simeon Baldwin, Chauncey
Goodrich and other magnificoes of the time and place, and even
by Webster himself. The field was thus open to the laborious
and truculent Noah. He was already the acknowledged magister
of lexicography in America, and there was an active public demand
for a dictionary that should be wholly American. The
appearance of his first duodecimo, according to Williams,<a name="FNanchor_6_387" id="FNanchor_6_387"></a><a
href="#Footnote_6_387" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
thereby took on something of the character of a national event.
It was received, not critically, but patriotically, and its imperfections
were swallowed as eagerly as its merits. Later on Webster
had to meet formidable critics, at home as well as abroad,
but for nearly a quarter of a century he reigned almost unchallenged.
Edition after edition of his dictionary was published, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg250"></a>[Pg250]</span>
each new one showing additions and improvements. Finally, in
1828, he printed his great "<i>American</i> Dictionary of the English
Language," in two large octavo volumes. It held the field for
half a century, not only against Worcester and the other American
lexicographers who followed him, but also against the best
dictionaries produced in England. Until very lately, indeed,
America remained ahead of England in practical dictionary making.</p>

<p>Webster had declared boldly for simpler spellings in his early
spelling books; in his dictionary of 1806 he made an assault at
all arms upon some of the dearest prejudices of English lexicographers.
Grounding his wholesale reforms upon a saying by
Franklin, that "those people spell best who do not know how
to spell"—<i class="abblatin">i. e.</i>, who spell phonetically and logically—he made
an almost complete sweep of whole classes of silent letters—the
<i>u</i> in the <i>-our</i> words, the final <i>e</i> in <i>determine</i> and <i>requisite</i>, the
silent <i>a</i> in <i>thread</i>, <i>feather</i> and <i>steady</i>, the silent <i>b</i> in <i>thumb</i>, the
<i>s</i> in <i>island</i>, the <i>o</i> in <i>leopard</i>, and the redundant consonants in
<i>traveler</i>, <i>wagon</i>, <i>jeweler</i>, etc. (English: <i>traveller</i>, <i>waggon</i>, <i>jeweller</i>).
More, he lopped the final <i>k</i> from <i>frolick</i>, <i>physick</i> and
their analogues. Yet more, he transposed the <i>e</i> and the <i>r</i> in all
words ending in <i>re</i>, such as <i>theatre</i>, <i>lustre</i>, <i>centre</i> and <i>calibre</i>.
Yet more, he changed the <i>c</i> in all words of the <i>defence</i> class to <i>s</i>.
Yet more, he changed <i>ph</i> to <i>f</i> in words of the <i>phantom</i> class,
<i>ou</i> to <i>oo</i> in words of the <i>group</i> class, <i>ow</i> to <i>ou</i> in <i>crowd</i>, <i>porpoise</i>
to <i>porpess</i>, <i>acre</i> to <i>aker</i>, <i>sew</i> to <i>soe</i>, <i>woe</i> to <i>wo</i>, <i>soot</i> to <i>sut</i>, <i>gaol</i>
to <i>jail</i>, and <i>plough</i> to <i>plow</i>. Finally, he antedated the simplified
spellers by inventing a long list of boldly phonetic spellings,
ranging from <i>tung</i> for <i>tongue</i> to <i>wimmen</i> for <i>women</i>, and from
<i>hainous</i> for <i>heinous</i> to <i>cag</i> for <i>keg</i>.</p>

<p>A good many of these new spellings, of course, were not
actually Webster's inventions. For example, the change from
<i>-our</i> to <i>-or</i> in words of the <i>honor</i> class was a mere echo of an
earlier English usage, or, more accurately, of an earlier English
uncertainty. In the first three folios of Shakespeare, 1623, 1632
and 1663-6, <i>honor</i> and <i>honour</i> were used indiscriminately and
in almost equal proportions; English spelling was still fluid, and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg251"></a>[Pg251]</span>
the <i>-our</i>-form was not consistently adopted until the fourth folio
of 1685. Moreover, John Wesley, the founder of Methodism,
is authority for the statement that the <i>-or</i>-form was "a fashionable
impropriety" in England in 1791. But the great authority
of Johnson stood against it, and Webster was surely not one
to imitate fashionable improprieties. He deleted the <i>u</i> for
purely etymological reasons, going back to the Latin <i>honor</i>, <i>favor</i>
and <i>odor</i> without taking account of the intermediate French
<i>honneur</i>, <i>faveur</i> and <i>odeur</i>. And where no etymological reasons
presented themselves, he made his changes by analogy and
for the sake of uniformity, or for euphony or simplicity, or because
it pleased him, one guesses, to stir up the academic animals.
Webster, in fact, delighted in controversy, and was anything but
free from the national yearning to make a sensation.</p>

<p>A great many of his innovations, of course, failed to take root,
and in the course of time he abandoned some of them himself.
In his early "Essay on the Necessity, Advantage and Practicability
of Reforming the Mode of Spelling" he advocated reforms
which were already discarded by the time he published the first
edition of his dictionary. Among them were the dropping of
the silent letter in such words as <i>head</i>, <i>give</i>, <i>built</i> and <i>realm</i>,
making them <i>hed</i>, <i>giv</i>, <i>bilt</i> and <i>relm</i>; the substitution of doubled
vowels for decayed diphthongs in such words as <i>mean</i>, <i>zeal</i> and
<i>near</i>, making them <i>meen</i>, <i>zeel</i> and <i>neer</i>; and the substitution of
<i>sh</i> for <i>ch</i> in such French loan-words as <i>machine</i> and <i>chevalier</i>,
making them <i>masheen</i> and <i>shevaleer</i>. He also declared for <i>stile</i>
in place of <i>style</i>, and for many other such changes, and then
quietly abandoned them. The successive editions of his dictionary
show still further concessions. <i>Croud</i>, <i>fether</i>, <i>groop</i>, <i>gillotin</i>,
<i>iland</i>, <i>insted</i>, <i>leperd</i>, <i>soe</i>, <i>sut</i>, <i>steddy</i>, <i>thret</i>, <i>thred</i>, <i>thum</i> and
<i>wimmen</i> appear only in the 1806 edition. In 1828 he went back
to <i>crowd</i>, <i>feather</i>, <i>group</i>, <i>island</i>, <i>instead</i>, <i>leopard</i>, <i>sew</i>, <i>soot</i>,
<i>steady</i>, <i>thread</i>, <i>threat</i>, <i>thumb</i> and <i>women</i>, and changed <i>gillotin</i>
to <i>guillotin</i>. In addition, he restored the final <i>e</i> in <i>determine</i>,
<i>discipline</i>, <i>requisite</i>, <i>imagine</i>, etc. In 1838, revising his dictionary,
he abandoned a good many spellings that had appeared
in either the 1806 or the 1828 edition, notably <i>maiz</i> for <i>maize</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg252"></a>[Pg252]</span>
<i>suveran</i> for <i>sovereign</i> and <i>guillotin</i> for <i>guillotine</i>. But he stuck
manfully to a number that were quite as revolutionary—for example,
<i>aker</i> for <i>acre</i>, <i>cag</i> for <i>keg</i>, <i>grotesk</i> for <i>grotesque</i>, <i>hainous</i>
for <i>heinous</i>, <i>porpess</i> for <i>porpoise</i> and <i>tung</i> for <i>tongue</i>—and they
did not begin to disappear until the edition of 1854, issued by
other hands and eleven years after his death. Three of his favorites,
<i>chimist</i> for <i>chemist</i>, <i>neger</i> for <i>negro</i> and <i>zeber</i> for <i>zebra</i>,
are incidentally interesting as showing changes in American pronunciation.
He abandoned <i>zeber</i> in 1828, but remained faithful
to <i>chimist</i> and <i>neger</i> to the last.</p>

<p>But though he was thus forced to give occasional ground, and
in more than one case held out in vain, Webster lived to see the
majority of his reforms adopted by his countrymen. He left
the ending in <i>-or</i> triumphant over the ending in <i>-our</i>, he shook
the security of the ending in <i>-re</i>, he rid American spelling of a
great many doubled consonants, he established the <i>s</i> in words of
the <i>defense</i> group, and he gave currency to many characteristic
American spellings, notably <i>jail</i>, <i>wagon</i>, <i>plow</i>, <i>mold</i> and <i>ax</i>.
These spellings still survive, and are practically universal in the
United States today; their use constitutes one of the most obvious
differences between written English and written American.
Moreover, they have founded a general tendency, the effects of
which reach far beyond the field actually traversed by Webster
himself. New words, and particularly loan-words, are simplified,
and hence naturalized in American much more quickly than
in English. <i>Employé</i> has long since become <i>employee</i> in our
newspapers, and <i>asphalte</i> has lost its final <i>e</i>, and <i>manoeuvre</i> has
become <i>maneuver</i>, and <i>pyjamas</i> has become <i>pajamas</i>. Even the
terminology of science is simplified and Americanized. In medicine,
for example, the highest American usage countenances many
forms which would seem barbarisms to an English medical man if
he encountered them in the <i>Lancet</i>. In derivatives of the Greek
<i>haima</i> it is the almost invariable American custom to spell the
root syllable <i>hem</i>, but the more conservative English make it
<i>haem</i>—<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, in <i>haemorrhage</i> and <i>haemiplegia</i>. In an exhaustive
list of diseases issued by the United States Public Health <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg253"></a>[Pg253]</span>
Service<a name="FNanchor_7_388" id="FNanchor_7_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_388" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the <i>haem</i>-form does not appear once. In the same way
American usage prefers <i>esophagus</i>, <i>diarrhea</i> and <i>gonorrhea</i> to
the English <i>oesophagus</i>, <i>diarrhoea</i> and <i>gonorrhoea</i>. In the style-book
of the <cite>Journal</cite> of the American Medical Association<a name="FNanchor_8_389" id="FNanchor_8_389"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_389" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I
find many other spellings that would shock an English medical
author, among them <i>curet</i> for <i>curette</i>, <i>cocain</i> for <i>cocaine</i>, <i>gage</i>
for <i>gauge</i>, <i>intern</i> for <i>interne</i>, <i>lacrimal</i> for <i>lachrymal</i>, and a whole
group of words ending in <i>-er</i> instead of in <i>-re</i>.</p>

<p>Webster's reforms, it goes without saying, have not passed unchallenged
by the guardians of tradition. A glance at the literature
of the first years of the nineteenth century shows that
most of the serious authors of the time ignored his new spellings,
though they were quickly adopted by the newspapers. Bancroft's
"Life of Washington" contains <i>-our</i> endings in all such
words as <i>honor</i>, <i>ardor</i> and <i>favor</i>. Washington Irving also threw
his influence against the <i>-or</i> ending, and so did Bryant and most
of the other literary big-wigs of that day. After the appearance
of "An American Dictionary of the English Language,"
in 1828, a formal battle was joined, with Lyman Cobb and Joseph
E. Worcester as the chief opponents of the reformer. Cobb
and Worcester, in the end, accepted the <i>-or</i> ending and so surrendered
on the main issue, but various other champions arose
to carry on the war. Edward S. Gould, in a once famous essay,<a name="FNanchor_9_390" id="FNanchor_9_390"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9_390" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
denounced the whole Websterian orthography with the utmost
fury, and Bryant, reprinting this philippic in the <cite>Evening Post</cite>,
said that on account of Webster "the English language has been
undergoing a process of corruption for the last quarter of a century,"
and offered to contribute to a fund to have Gould's denunciation
"read twice a year in every school-house in the
United States, until every trace of Websterian spelling disappears
from the land." But Bryant was forced to admit that,
even in 1856, the chief novelties of the Connecticut school-master
"who taught millions to read but not one to sin" were <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg254"></a>[Pg254]</span> "adopted
and propagated by the largest publishing house, through the
columns of the most widely circulated monthly magazine, and
through one of the ablest and most widely circulated newspapers
in the United States"—which is to say, the <cite>Tribune</cite> under
Greeley. The last academic attack was delivered by Bishop
Coxe in 1886, and he contented himself with the resigned statement
that "Webster has corrupted our spelling sadly." Lounsbury,
with his active interest in spelling reform, ranged himself
on the side of Webster, and effectively disposed of the controversy
by showing that the great majority of his spellings were
supported by precedents quite as respectable as those behind the
fashionable English spellings. In Lounsbury's opinion, a good
deal of the opposition to them was no more than a symptom of
antipathy to all things American among certain Englishmen
and of subservience to all things English among certain Americans.<a name="FNanchor_10_391" id="FNanchor_10_391"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10_391" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Webster's inconsistency gave his opponents a formidable
weapon for use against him—until it began to be noticed that
the orthodox English spelling was quite as inconsistent. He
sought to change <i>acre</i> to <i>aker</i>, but left <i>lucre</i> unchanged. He removed
the final <i>f</i> from <i>bailiff</i>, <i>mastiff</i>, <i>plaintiff</i> and <i>pontiff</i>, but
left it in <i>distaff</i>. He changed <i>c</i> to <i>s</i> in words of the <i>offense</i> class,
but left the <i>c</i> in <i>fence</i>. He changed the <i>ck</i> in <i>frolick</i>, <i>physick</i>,
etc., into a simple <i>c</i>, but restored it in such derivatives as <i>frolicksome</i>.
He deleted the silent <i>u</i> in <i>mould</i>, but left it in <i>court</i>.
These slips were made the most of by Cobb in a pamphlet printed
in 1831.<a name="FNanchor_11_392" id="FNanchor_11_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_392" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He also detected Webster in the frequent <i>faux pas</i>
of using spellings in his definitions and explanations that conflicted
with the spellings he advocated. Various other purists
joined in the attack, and it was renewed with great fury after
the appearance of Worcester's dictionary, in 1846. Worcester,
who had begun his lexicographical labors by editing Johnson's
dictionary, was a good deal more conservative than Webster,
and so the partisans of conformity rallied around him, and for <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg255"></a>[Pg255]</span>
a while the controversy took on all the rancor of a personal
quarrel. Even the editions of Webster printed after his death,
though they gave way on many points, were violently arraigned.
Gould, in 1867, belabored the editions of 1854 and 1866,<a name="FNanchor_12_393" id="FNanchor_12_393"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_393" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and
complained that "for the past twenty-five years the Websterian
replies have uniformly been bitter in tone, and very free in the
imputation of personal motives, or interested or improper motives,
on the part of opposing critics." At this time Webster
himself had been dead for twenty-two years. Schele de Vere,
during the same year, denounced the publishers of the Webster
dictionaries for applying "immense capital and a large stock of
energy and perseverance" to the propagation of his "new and
arbitrarily imposed orthography."<a name="FNanchor_13_394" id="FNanchor_13_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_394" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 4</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Exchanges"></a>Exchanges</h3>—As in vocabulary and in idiom, there are constant
exchanges between English and American in the department
of orthography. Here the influence of English usage is almost
uniformly toward conservatism, and that of American usage is
as steadily in the other direction. The logical superiority of
American spelling is well exhibited by its persistent advance in
the face of the utmost hostility. The English objection to our
simplifications, as Brander Matthews points out, is not wholly
or even chiefly etymological; its roots lie, to borrow James Russell
Lowell's phrase, in an esthetic hatred burning "with as fierce a
flame as ever did theological hatred." There is something inordinately
offensive to English purists in the very thought of
taking lessons from this side of the water, particularly in the
mother tongue. The opposition, transcending the academic,
takes on the character of the patriotic. "Any American," continues
Matthews, "who chances to note the force and the fervor
and the frequency of the objurgations against American spelling
in the columns of the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>, for example, and of the
<cite>Athenaeum</cite>, may find himself wondering as to the date of the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg256"></a>[Pg256]</span>
papal bull which declared the infallibility of contemporary British
orthography, and as to the place where the council of the
Church was held at which it was made an article of faith."<a name="FNanchor_14_395" id="FNanchor_14_395"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_395" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
This was written more than a quarter of a century ago. Since
then there has been a lessening of violence, but the opposition
still continues. No self-respecting English author would yield
up the <i>-our</i> ending for an instant, or write <i>check</i> for <i>cheque</i>,
or transpose the last letters in the <i>-re</i> words.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, American spelling makes constant gains across
the water, and they more than offset the occasional fashions for
English spellings on this side. Schele de Vere, in 1867, consoled
himself for Webster's "arbitrarily imposed orthography"
by predicting that it could be "only temporary"—that, in the
long run, "North America depends exclusively on the mother-country
for its models of literature." But the event has blasted
this prophecy and confidence, for the English, despite their furious
reluctance, have succumbed to Webster more than once.
The New English Dictionary, a monumental work, shows many
silent concessions, and quite as many open yieldings—for example,
in the case of <i>ax</i>, which is admitted to be "better than <i>axe</i>
on every ground." Moreover, English usage tends to march
ahead of it, outstripping the liberalism of its editor, Sir James
A. H. Murray. In 1914, for example, Sir James was still protesting
against dropping the first <i>e</i> from <i>judgement</i>, a characteristic
Americanism, but during the same year the Fowlers, in
their Concise Oxford Dictionary, put <i>judgment</i> ahead of <i>judgement</i>;
and two years earlier the Authors' and Printers' Dictionary,
edited by Horace Hart,<a name="FNanchor_15_396" id="FNanchor_15_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_396" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> had dropped <i>judgement</i> altogether.
Hart is Controller of the Oxford University Press, and
the Authors' and Printers' Dictionary is an authority accepted
by nearly all of the great English book publishers and newspapers.
Its last edition shows a great many American spellings.
For example, it recommends the use of <i>jail</i> and <i>jailer</i> in place <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg257"></a>[Pg257]</span>
of the English <i>gaol</i> and <i>gaoler</i>, says that <i>ax</i> is better than <i>axe</i>,
drops the final <i>e</i> from <i>asphalte</i> and <i>forme</i>, changes the <i>y</i> to <i>i</i>
in <i>cyder</i>, <i>cypher</i> and <i>syren</i> and advocates the same change in
<i>tyre</i>, drops the redundant <i>t</i> from <i>nett</i>, changes <i>burthen</i> to <i>burden</i>,
spells <i>wagon</i> with one <i>g</i>, prefers <i>fuse</i> to <i>fuze</i>, and takes the
<i>e</i> out of <i>storey</i>. "Rules for Compositors and Readers at the
University Press, Oxford," also edited by Hart (with the advice
of Sir James Murray and Dr. Henry Bradley), is another
very influential English authority.<a name="FNanchor_16_397" id="FNanchor_16_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_397" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It gives its imprimatur
to <i>bark</i> (a ship), <i>cipher</i>, <i>siren</i>, <i>jail</i>, <i>story</i>, <i>tire</i> and <i>wagon</i>, and
even advocates <i>kilogram</i> and <i>omelet</i>. Finally, there is Cassell's
English Dictionary.<a name="FNanchor_17_398" id="FNanchor_17_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_398" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It clings to the <i>-our</i> and <i>-re</i> endings and
to <i>annexe</i>, <i>waggon</i> and <i>cheque</i>, but it prefers <i>jail</i> to <i>gaol</i>, <i>net</i> to
<i>nett</i>, <i>asphalt</i> to <i>asphalte</i> and <i>story</i> to <i>storey</i>, and comes out flatly
for <i>judgment</i>, <i>fuse</i> and <i>siren</i>.</p>

<p>Current English spelling, like our own, shows a number of
uncertainties and inconsistencies, and some of them are undoubtedly
the result of American influences that have not yet become
fully effective. The lack of harmony in the <i>-our</i> words, leading
to such discrepancies as <i>honorary</i> and <i>honourable</i>, I have already
mentioned. The British Board of Trade, in attempting to fix
the spelling of various scientific terms, has often come to grief.
Thus it detaches the final <i>-me</i> from <i>gramme</i> in such compounds
as <i>kilogram</i> and <i>milligram</i>, but insists upon <i>gramme</i> when the
word stands alone. In American usage <i>gram</i> is now common,
and scarcely challenged. All the English authorities that I
have consulted prefer <i>metre</i> and <i>calibre</i> to the American <i>meter</i>
and <i>caliber</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_399" id="FNanchor_18_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_399" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> They also support the <i>ae</i> in such words as <i>aetiology</i>,
<i>aesthetics</i>, <i>mediaeval</i> and <i>anaemia</i>, and the <i>oe</i> in <i>oesophagus</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg258"></a>[Pg258]</span>
<i>manoeuvre</i> and <i>diarrhoea</i>. They also cling to such forms as
<i>mollusc</i>, <i>kerb</i>, <i>pyjamas</i> and <i>ostler</i>, and to the use of <i>x</i> instead
of <i>ct</i> in <i>connexion</i> and <i>inflexion</i>. The Authors' and Printers'
Dictionary admits the American <i>curb</i>, but says that the English
<i>kerb</i> is more common. It gives <i>barque</i>, <i>plough</i> and <i>fount</i>, but
grants that <i>bark</i>, <i>plow</i> and <i>font</i> are good in America. As between
<i>inquiry</i> and <i>enquiry</i>, it prefers the American <i>inquiry</i> to
the English <i>enquiry</i>, but it rejects the American <i>inclose</i> and
<i>indorse</i> in favor of the English <i>enclose</i> and <i>endorse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_400" id="FNanchor_19_400"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_400" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Here
American spelling has driven in a salient, but has yet to take
the whole position. A number of spellings, nearly all American,
are trembling on the brink of acceptance in both countries.
Among them is <i>rime</i> (for <i>rhyme</i>). This spelling was correct in
England until about 1530, but its recent revival was of American
origin. It is accepted by the Oxford Dictionary and by the
editors of the Cambridge History of English Literature, but it
seldom appears in an English journal. The same may be said
of <i>grewsome</i>. It has got a footing in both countries, but the
weight of English opinion is still against it. <i>Develop</i> (instead
of <i>develope</i>) has gone further in both countries. So has <i>engulf</i>,
for <i>engulph</i>. So has <i>gipsy</i> for <i>gypsy</i>.</p>

<p>American imitation of English orthography has two impulses
behind it. First, there is the colonial spirit, the desire to pass
as English—in brief, mere affectation. Secondly, there is the
wish among printers, chiefly of books and periodicals, to reach
a compromise spelling acceptable in both countries, thus avoiding
expensive revisions in case of republication in England.<a name="FNanchor_20_401" id="FNanchor_20_401"></a><a
href="#Footnote_20_401" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg259"></a>[Pg259]</span>
The first influence need not detain us. It is chiefly visible among
folk of fashionable pretensions, and is not widespread. At Bar
Harbor, in Maine, some of the summer residents are at great
pains to put <i>harbour</i> instead of <i>harbor</i> on their stationery, but
the local postmaster still continues to stamp all mail <i>Bar Harbor</i>,
the legal name of the place. In the same way American haberdashers
sometimes advertise <i>pyjamas</i> instead of <i>pajamas</i>, just
as they advertise <i>braces</i> instead of <i>suspenders</i> and <i>vests</i> instead
of <i>undershirts</i>. But this benign folly does not go very far.
Beyond occasionally clinging to the <i>-re</i> ending in words of the
<i>theatre</i> group, all American newspapers and magazines employ
the native orthography, and it would be quite as startling to
encounter <i>honour</i> or <i>jewellery</i> in one of them as it would be to
encounter <i>gaol</i> or <i>waggon</i>. Even the most fashionable jewelers
in Fifth avenue still deal in <i>jewelry</i>, not in <i>jewellery</i>.</p>

<p>The second influence is of more effect and importance. In
the days before the copyright treaty between England and the
United States, one of the standing arguments against it among
the English was based upon the fear that it would flood England
with books set up in America, and so work a corruption of English
spelling.<a name="FNanchor_21_402" id="FNanchor_21_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_402" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This fear, as we have seen, had a certain plausibility;
there is not the slightest doubt that American books and
American magazines have done valiant missionary service for
American orthography. But English conservatism still holds
out stoutly enough to force American printers to certain compromises.
When a book is designed for circulation in both
countries it is common for the publisher to instruct the printer
to employ "English spelling." This English spelling, at the
Riverside Press,<a name="FNanchor_22_403" id="FNanchor_22_403"></a><a
href="#Footnote_22_403" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
embraces all the <i>-our</i> endings and the following
further forms:</p>

<div class="hidden"><span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg260"></a>[Pg260]</span></div>

<div class="ulist">
<p>cheque</p>
<p>chequered</p>
<p>connexion</p>
<p>dreamt</p>
<p>faggot</p>
<p>forgather</p>
<p>forgo</p>
<p>grey</p>
<p>inflexion</p>
<p>jewellery</p>
<p>leapt</p>
<p>premises (in logic)</p>
<p>waggon</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noted that <i>gaol</i>, <i>tyre</i>, <i>storey</i>, <i>kerb</i>, <i>asphalte</i>, <i>annexe</i>,
<i>ostler</i>, <i>mollusc</i> and <i>pyjamas</i> are not listed, nor are the words
ending in <i>-re</i>. These and their like constitute the English contribution
to the compromise. Two other great American book
presses, that of the Macmillan Company<a name="FNanchor_23_404" id="FNanchor_23_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_404" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and that of the J. S.
Cushing Company,<a name="FNanchor_24_405" id="FNanchor_24_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_405" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> add <i>gaol</i> and <i>storey</i> to the list, and also
<i>behove</i>, <i>briar</i>, <i>drily</i>, <i>enquire</i>, <i>gaiety</i>, <i>gipsy</i>, <i>instal</i>, <i>judgement</i>, <i>lacquey</i>,
<i>moustache</i>, <i>nought</i>, <i>pigmy</i>, <i>postillion</i>, <i>reflexion</i>, <i>shily</i>, <i>slily</i>,
<i>staunch</i> and <i>verandah</i>. Here they go too far, for, as we have
seen, the English themselves have begun to abandon <i>briar</i>, <i>enquire</i>
and <i>judgement</i>. Moreover, <i>lacquey</i> is going out over there,
and <i>gipsy</i> is not English, but American. The Riverside Press,
even in books intended only for America, prefers certain English
forms, among them, <i>anaemia</i>, <i>axe</i>, <i>mediaeval</i>, <i>mould</i>, <i>plough</i>,
<i>programme</i> and <i>quartette</i>, but in compensation it stands by such
typical Americanisms as <i>caliber</i>, <i>calk</i>, <i>center</i>, <i>cozy</i>, <i>defense</i>, <i>foregather</i>,
<i>gray</i>, <i>hemorrhage</i>, <i>luster</i>, <i>maneuver</i>, <i>mustache</i>, <i>theater</i>
and <i>woolen</i>. The Government Printing Office at Washington
follows Webster's New International Dictionary,<a name="FNanchor_25_406" id="FNanchor_25_406"></a><a
href="#Footnote_25_406" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which supports
most of the innovations of Webster himself. This dictionary
is the authority in perhaps a majority of American
printing offices, with the Standard and the Century supporting
it. The latter two also follow Webster, notably in his <i>-er</i> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg261"></a>[Pg261]</span>
endings and in his substitution of <i>s</i> for <i>c</i> in words of the <i>defense</i>
class. The Worcester Dictionary is the sole exponent of English
spelling in general circulation in the United States. It remains
faithful to most of the <i>-re</i> endings, and to <i>manoeuvre</i>,
<i>gramme</i>, <i>plough</i>, <i>sceptic</i>, <i>woollen</i>, <i>axe</i> and many other English
forms. But even Worcester favors such characteristic American
spellings as <i>behoove</i>, <i>brier</i>, <i>caliber</i>, <i>checkered</i>, <i>dryly</i>, <i>jail</i>
and <i>wagon</i>.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 5</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Simplified_Spelling"></a>Simplified Spelling</h3>—The current movement toward a general
reform of English-American spelling is of American origin, and
its chief supporters are Americans today. Its actual father was
Webster, for it was the long controversy over his simplified spellings
that brought the dons of the American Philological Association
to a serious investigation of the subject. In 1875 they
appointed a committee to inquire into the possibility of reform,
and in 1876 this committee reported favorably. During the
same year there was an International Convention for the Amendment
of English Orthography at Philadelphia, with several
delegates from England present, and out of it grew the Spelling
Reform Association.<a name="FNanchor_26_407" id="FNanchor_26_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_407" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In 1878 a committee of American philologists
began preparing a list of proposed new spellings, and two
years later the Philological Society of England joined in the
work. In 1883 a joint manifesto was issued, recommending
various general simplifications. In 1886 the American Philological
Association issued independently a list of recommendations
affecting about 3,500 words, and falling under ten headings.
Practically all of the changes proposed had been put
forward 80 years before by Webster, and some of them had
entered into unquestioned American usage in the meantime, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
the deletion of the <i>u</i> from the <i>-our</i> words, the substitution of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg262"></a>[Pg262]</span>
<i>er</i> for <i>re</i> at the end of words, the reduction of <i>traveller</i> to <i>traveler</i>,
and the substitution of <i>z</i> for <i>s</i> wherever phonetically demanded,
as in <i>advertize</i> and <i>cozy</i>.</div>

<p>The trouble with the others was that they were either too
uncouth to be adopted without a struggle or likely to cause errors
in pronunciation. To the first class belonged <i>tung</i> for <i>tongue</i>,
<i>ruf</i> for <i>rough</i>, <i>batl</i> for <i>battle</i> and <i>abuv</i> for <i>above</i>, and to the
second such forms as <i>cach</i> for <i>catch</i> and <i>troble</i> for <i>trouble</i>.
The result was that the whole reform received a set-back: the
public dismissed the industrious professors as a pack of dreamers.
Twelve years later the National Education Association revived
the movement with a proposal that a beginning be made
with a very short list of reformed spellings, and nominated the
following by way of experiment: <i>tho</i>, <i>altho</i>, <i>thru</i>, <i>thruout</i>, <i>thoro</i>,
<i>thoroly</i>, <i>thorofare</i>, <i>program</i>, <i>prolog</i>, <i>catalog</i>, <i>pedagog</i> and <i>decalog</i>.
This scheme of gradual changes was sound in principle,
and in a short time at least two of the recommended spellings,
<i>program</i> and <i>catalog</i>, were in general use. Then, in 1906, came
the organization of the Simplified Spelling Board, with an endowment
of $15,000 a year from Andrew Carnegie, and a formidable
membership of pundits. The board at once issued a list
of 300 revised spellings, new and old, and in August, 1906,
President Roosevelt ordered their adoption by the Government
Printing Office. But this unwise effort to hasten matters, combined
with the buffoonery characteristically thrown about the
matter by Roosevelt, served only to raise up enemies, and since
then, though it has prudently gone back to more discreet endeavors
and now lays main stress upon the original 12 words of
the National Education Association, the Board has not made a
great deal of progress.<a name="FNanchor_27_408" id="FNanchor_27_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_408" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> From time to time it issues impressive
lists of newspapers and periodicals that are using some, at least,
of its revised spellings and of colleges that have made them
optional, but an inspection of these lists shows that very few <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg263"></a>[Pg263]</span>
publications of any importance have been converted<a name="FNanchor_28_409" id="FNanchor_28_409"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_409" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and that
most of the great universities still hesitate. It has, however,
greatly reinforced the authority behind many of Webster's spellings,
and it has done much to reform scientific orthography.
Such forms as <i>gram</i>, <i>cocain</i>, <i>chlorid</i>, <i>anemia</i> and <i>anilin</i> are the
products of its influence.</p>

<p>Despite the large admixture of failure in this success there
is good reason to believe that at least two of the spellings on the
National Education Association list, <i>tho</i> and <i>thru</i>, are making
not a little quiet progress. I read a great many manuscripts
by American authors, and find in them an increasing use of
both forms, with the occasional addition of <i>altho</i>, <i>thoro</i> and
<i>thoroly</i>. The spirit of American spelling is on their side. They
promise to come in as <i>honor</i>, <i>bark</i>, <i>check</i>, <i>wagon</i> and <i>story</i> came
in many years ago, as <i>tire</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_410" id="FNanchor_29_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_410" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> <i>esophagus</i> and <i>theater</i> came in
later on, as <i>program</i>, <i>catalog</i> and <i>cyclopedia</i> came in only yesterday,
and as <i>airplane</i> (for <i>aëroplane</i>)<a name="FNanchor_30_411" id="FNanchor_30_411"></a><a
href="#Footnote_30_411" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> is coming in today. A
constant tendency toward logic and simplicity is visible; if the
spelling of English and American does not grow farther and
farther apart it is only because American drags English along.
There is incessant experimentalization. New forms appear, are
tested, and then either gain general acceptance or disappear.
One such, now struggling for recognition, is <i>alright</i>, a compound
of <i>all</i> and <i>right</i>, made by analogy with <i>already</i> and <i>almost</i>. I
find it in American manuscripts every day, and it not infrequently
gets into print.<a name="FNanchor_31_412" id="FNanchor_31_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_412" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> So far no dictionary supports it, but <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg264"></a>[Pg264]</span>
it has already migrated to England.<a name="FNanchor_32_413" id="FNanchor_32_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_413" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Meanwhile, one often
encounters, in American advertising matter, such experimental
forms as <i>burlesk</i>, <i>foto</i>, <i>fonograph</i>, <i>kandy</i>, <i>kar</i>, <i>holsum</i>, <i>kumfort</i>
and <i>Q-room</i>, not to mention <i>sulfur</i>. <i>Segar</i> has been more or
less in use for half a century, and at one time it threatened to
displace <i>cigar</i>. At least one American professor of English
predicts that such forms will eventually prevail. Even <i>fosfate</i>
and <i>fotograph</i>, he says, "are bound to be the spellings of the
future."<a name="FNanchor_33_414" id="FNanchor_33_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_414" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 6</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Minor_Differences"></a>Minor Differences</h3>—Various minor differences remain to be noticed.
One is a divergence in orthography due to differences in
pronunciation. <i>Specialty</i>, <i>aluminum</i> and <i>alarm</i> offer examples.
In English they are <i>speciality</i>, <i>aluminium</i> and <i>alarum</i>, though
<i>alarm</i> is also an alternative form. <i>Specialty</i>, in America, is always
accented on the first syllable; <i>speciality</i>, in England, on the
third. The result is two distinct words, though their meaning
is identical. How <i>aluminium</i>, in America, lost its fourth syllable
I have been unable to determine, but all American authorities
now make it <i>aluminum</i> and all English authorities stick to
<i>aluminium</i>.</div>

<p>Another difference in usage is revealed in the spelling and
pluralization of foreign words. Such words, when they appear
in an English publication, even a newspaper, almost invariably
bear the correct accents, but in the United States it is almost as
invariably the rule to omit these accents, save in publications
of considerable pretensions. This is notably the case with <i>café</i>
<i>crêpe</i>, <i>début</i>, <i>débutante</i>, <i>portière</i>, <i>levée</i>, <i>éclat</i>, <i>fête</i>, <i>régime</i>, <i>rôle</i>,
<i>soirée</i>, <i>protégé</i>, <i>élite</i>, <i>mêlée</i>, <i>tête-à-tête</i> and <i>répertoire</i>. It is rare
to encounter any of them with its proper accents in an American
newspaper; it is rare to encounter them unaccented in an English <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg265"></a>[Pg265]</span>
newspaper. This slaughter of the accents, it must be obvious,
greatly aids the rapid naturalization of a newcomer. It
loses much of its foreignness at once, and is thus easier to absorb.
<i>Dépôt</i> would have been a long time working its way into American
had it remained <i>dépôt</i>, but immediately it became plain
<i>depot</i> it got in. The process is constantly going on. I often
encounter <i>naïveté</i> without its accents, and even <i>déshabille</i>, <i>hofbräu</i>,
<i>señor</i> and <i>résumé</i>. <i>Cañon</i> was changed to <i>canyon</i> years
ago, and the cases of <i>exposé</i>, <i>divorcée</i>, <i>schmierkäse</i>, <i>employé</i>
and <i>matinée</i> are familiar. At least one American dignitary of
learning, Brander Matthews, has openly defended and even
advocated this clipping of accents. In speaking of <i>naïf</i> and
<i>naïveté</i>, which he welcomes because "we have no exact equivalent
for either word," he says: "But they will need to shed
their accents and to adapt themselves somehow to the traditions
of our orthography."<a name="FNanchor_34_415" id="FNanchor_34_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_415" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He goes on: "After we have decided
that the foreign word we find knocking at the doors of English
[he really means American, as the context shows] is likely to
be useful, we must fit it for naturalization by insisting that it
shall shed its accents, if it has any; that it shall change its
spelling, if this is necessary; that it shall modify its pronunciation,
if this is not easy for us to compass; and that it shall conform
to all our speech-habits, especially in the formation of the
plural."<a name="FNanchor_35_416" id="FNanchor_35_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_416" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In this formation of the plural, as elsewhere, English regards
the precedents and American makes new ones. All the English
authorities that I have had access to advocate retaining the foreign
plurals of most of the foreign words in daily use, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>sanatoria</i>, <i>appendices</i>, <i>virtuosi</i>, <i>formulae</i> and <i>libretti</i>. But American
usage favors plurals of native cut, and the <cite>Journal</cite> of the
American Medical Association goes so far as to approve <i>curriculums</i>
and <i>septums</i>. <i>Banditti</i>, in place of <i>bandits</i>, would seem
an affectation in America, and so would <i>soprani</i> for <i>sopranos</i> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg266"></a>[Pg266]</span>
and <i>soli</i> for <i>solos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36_417" id="FNanchor_36_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_417" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The last two are common in England.
Both English and American labor under the lack of native
plurals for the two everyday titles, <i>Mister</i> and <i>Missus</i>. In the
written speech, and in the more exact forms of the spoken
speech, the French plurals, <i>Messieurs</i> and <i>Mesdames</i>, are used,
but in the ordinary spoken speech, at least in America, they are
avoided by circumlocution. When <i>Messieurs</i> has to be spoken
it is almost invariably pronounced <i>messers</i>, and in the same way
<i>Mesdames</i> becomes <i>mez-dames</i>, with the first syllable rhyming
with <i>sez</i> and the second, which bears the accent, with <i>games</i>.
In place of <i>Mesdames</i> a more natural form, <i>Madames</i>, seems to
be gaining ground in America. Thus, I lately found <i>Dames du
Sacré Coeur</i> translated as <i>Madames of the Sacred Heart</i> in a
Catholic paper of wide circulation,<a name="FNanchor_37_418" id="FNanchor_37_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_418" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and the form is apparently
used by American members of the community.</p>

<p>In capitalization the English are a good deal more conservative
than we are. They invariably capitalize such terms as <i>Government</i>,
<i>Prime Minister</i> and <i>Society</i>, when used as proper
nouns; they capitalize <i>Press</i>, <i>Pulpit</i>, <i>Bar</i>, etc., almost as often.
In America a movement against this use of capitals appeared
during the latter part of the eighteenth century. In Jefferson's
first draft of the Declaration of Independence <i>nature</i> and <i>creator</i>,
and even <i>god</i> are in lower case.<a name="FNanchor_38_419" id="FNanchor_38_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_419" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> During the 20's and 30's of
the succeeding century, probably as a result of French influence,
the disdain of capitals went so far that the days of the week
were often spelled with small initial letters, and even <i>Mr.</i> became
<i>mr</i>. Curiously enough, the most striking exhibition of
this tendency of late years is offered by an English work of
the highest scholarship, the Cambridge History of English Literature.
It uses the lower case for all titles, even <i>baron</i> and
<i>colonel</i> before proper names, and also avoids capitals in such <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg267"></a>[Pg267]</span>
words as <i>presbyterian</i>, <i>catholic</i> and <i>christian</i>, and in the second
parts of such terms as Westminster <i>abbey</i> and Atlantic <i>ocean</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, there are certain differences in punctuation. The
English, as everyone knows, put a comma after the street number
of a house, making it, for example, <i>34, St. James street</i>.
They usually insert a comma instead of a period after the hour
when giving the time in figures, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>9,27</i>, and omit the <i>0</i> when
indicating less than 10 minutes, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>8,7</i> instead of <i>8.07</i>. They
do not use the period as the mark of the decimal, but employ a
dot at the level of the upper dot of a colon, as in <i>3·1416</i>. They
cling to the hyphen in such words as <i>to-day</i> and <i>to-night</i>; it begins
to disappear in America. They use <i>an</i> before <i>hotel</i> and
<i>historical</i>; Kipling has even used it before <i>hydraulic</i>;<a name="FNanchor_39_420" id="FNanchor_39_420"></a><a
href="#Footnote_39_420" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> American
usage prefers <i>a</i>. But these small differences need not be
pursued further.</p>

on pages 11 and 23 of A Report on the Treatment by the Enemy of British
Prisoners of War Behind the Firing Lines in France and Belgium; Miscellaneous

Proper Names in America</h2>

<p class="ph3number">§ 1</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Surnames"></a>Surnames</h3>—A glance
at any American city directory is sufficient
to show that, despite the continued political and cultural
preponderance of the original English strain, the American people
have quite ceased to be authentically English in race, or even
authentically British. The blood in their arteries is inordinately
various and inextricably mixed, but yet not mixed enough to run
a clear stream. A touch of foreignness still lingers about millions
of them, even in the country of their birth. They show
their alien origin in their speech, in their domestic customs, in
their habits of mind, and in their very names. Just as the
Scotch and the Welsh have invaded England, elbowing out the
actual English to make room for themselves, so the Irish, the
Germans, the Italians, the Scandinavians and the Jews of Eastern
Europe, and in some areas, the French, the Slavs and the
hybrid-Spaniards have elbowed out the descendants of the first
colonists. It is not exaggerating, indeed, to say that wherever
the old stock comes into direct and unrestrained conflict with
one of these new stocks, it tends to succumb, or, at all events, to
give up the battle. The Irish, in the big cities of the East, attained
to a truly impressive political power long before the first
native-born generation of them had grown up.<a name="FNanchor_1_421" id="FNanchor_1_421"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_421" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Germans,
following the limestone belt of the Alleghany foothills, pre-empted
the best lands East of the mountains before the new <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg269"></a>[Pg269]</span>
republic was born.<a name="FNanchor_2_422" id="FNanchor_2_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_422" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And so, in our own time, we have seen the
Swedes and Norwegians shouldering the native from the wheat
lands of the Northwest, and the Italians driving the decadent
New Englanders from their farms, and the Jews gobbling New
York, and the Slavs getting a firm foothold in the mining regions,
and the French Canadians penetrating New Hampshire
and Vermont, and the Japanese and Portuguese menacing Hawaii,
and the awakened negroes gradually ousting the whites
from the farms of the South.<a name="FNanchor_3_423" id="FNanchor_3_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_423" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The birth-rate among all these
foreign stocks is enormously greater than among the older stock,
and though the death-rate is also high, the net increase remains
relatively formidable. Even without the aid of immigration it
is probable that they would continue to rise in numbers faster
than the original English and so-called Scotch-Irish.<a name="FNanchor_4_424" id="FNanchor_4_424"></a><a

<p>Turn to the letter <i>z</i> in the New York telephone directory and
you will find a truly astonishing array of foreign names, some
of them in process of anglicization, but many of them still arrestingly
outlandish. The only Anglo-Saxon surname beginning
with <i>z</i> is <i>Zacharias</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_425" id="FNanchor_5_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_425" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and even that was originally borrowed from
the Greek. To this the Norman invasion seems to have added
only <i>Zouchy</i>. But in Manhattan and the Bronx, even among
the necessarily limited class of telephone subscribers, there are
nearly 1500 persons whose names begin with the letter, and
among them one finds fully 150 different surnames. The German
<i>Zimmermann</i>, with either one <i>n</i> or two, is naturally the
most numerous single name, and following close upon it are its
derivatives, <i>Zimmer</i> and <i>Zimmern</i>. With them are many more
German names: <i>Zahn</i>, <i>Zechendorf</i>, <i>Zeffert</i>, <i>Zeitler</i>, <i>Zeller</i>,
<i>Zellner</i>, <i>Zeltmacher</i>, <i>Zepp</i>, <i>Ziegfeld</i>, <i>Zabel</i>, <i>Zucker</i>, <i>Zuckermann</i>,
<i>Ziegler</i>, <i>Zillman</i>, <i>Zinser</i> and so on. They are all represented
heavily, but they indicate neither the earliest nor the
most formidable accretion, for underlying them are many Dutch <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg270"></a>[Pg270]</span>
names, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Zeeman</i> and <i>Zuurmond</i>, and over them are a large
number of Slavic, Italian and Jewish names. Among the first I
note <i>Zabludosky</i>, <i>Zabriskie</i>, <i>Zachczynski</i>, <i>Zapinkow</i>, <i>Zaretsky</i>,
<i>Zechnowitz</i>, <i>Zenzalsky</i> and <i>Zywachevsky</i>; among the second,
<i>Zaccardi</i>, <i>Zaccarini</i>, <i>Zaccaro</i>, <i>Zapparano</i>, <i>Zanelli</i>, <i>Zicarelli</i> and
<i>Zucca</i>; among the third, <i>Zukor</i>, <i>Zipkin</i> and <i>Ziskind</i>. There
are, too, various Spanish names: <i>Zelaya</i>, <i>Zingaro</i>, etc. And
Greek: <i>Zapeion</i>, <i>Zervakos</i> and <i>Zouvelekis</i>. And Armenian:
<i>Zaloom</i>, <i>Zaron</i> and <i>Zatmajian</i>. And Hungarian: <i>Zadek</i>,
<i>Zagor</i> and <i>Zichy</i>. And Swedish: <i>Zetterholm</i> and <i>Zetterlund</i>.
And a number that defy placing: <i>Zrike</i>, <i>Zvan</i>, <i>Zwipf</i>, <i>Zula</i>,
<i>Zur</i> and <i>Zeve</i>.</p>

<p>Any other American telephone directory will show the same
extraordinary multiplication of exotic patronymics. I choose, at
random, that of Pittsburgh, and confine myself to the saloon-keepers
and clergymen. Among the former I find a great many
German names: <i>Artz</i>, <i>Bartels</i>, <i>Blum</i>, <i>Gaertner</i>, <i>Dittmer</i>, <i>Hahn</i>,
<i>Pfeil</i>, <i>Schuman</i>, <i>Schlegel</i>, <i>von Hedemann</i>, <i>Weiss</i> and so on. And
Slavic names: <i>Blaszkiewicz</i>, <i>Bukosky</i>, <i>Puwalowski</i>, <i>Krzykolski</i>,
<i>Tuladziecke</i> and <i>Stratkiewicz</i>. And Greek and Italian names:
<i>Markopoulos</i>, <i>Martinelli</i>, <i>Foglia</i>, <i>Gigliotti</i> and <i>Karabinos</i>. And
names beyond my determination: <i>Tyburski</i>, <i>Volongiatica</i>, <i>Herisko</i>
and <i>Hajduk</i>. Very few Anglo-Saxon names are on the
list; the continental foreigner seems to be driving out the native,
and even the Irishman, from the saloon business. Among
the clerics, naturally enough, there are more men of English
surname, but even here I find such strange names as <i>Auroroff</i>,
<i>Ashinsky</i>, <i>Bourajanis</i>, <i>Duic</i>, <i>Cillo</i>, <i>Mazure</i>, <i>Przvblski</i>, <i>Pniak</i>,
<i>Bazilevich</i>, <i>Smelsz</i> and <i>Vrhunec</i>. But Pittsburgh and New York,
it may be argued, are scarcely American; unrestricted immigration
has swamped them; the newcomers crowd into the cities.
Well, examine the roster of the national House of Representatives,
which surely represents the whole country. On it I find
<i>Bacharach</i>, <i>Dupré</i>, <i>Esch</i>, <i>Estopinal</i>, <i>Focht</i>, <i>Heintz</i>, <i>Kahn</i>, <i>Kiess</i>,
<i>Kreider</i>, <i>La Guardia</i>, <i>Kraus</i>, <i>Lazaro</i>, <i>Lehbach</i>, <i>Romjue</i>, <i>Siegel</i>
and <i>Zihlman</i>, not to mention the insular delegates, <i>Kalanianole</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg271"></a>[Pg271]</span>
<i>de Veyra</i>, <i>Davila</i> and <i>Yangko</i>, and enough Irishmen to organize
a parliament at Dublin.</p>

<p>In the New York city directory the fourth most common name
is now <i>Murphy</i>, an Irish name, and the fifth most common is
<i>Meyer</i>, which is German and chiefly Jewish. The <i>Meyers</i> are
the <i>Smiths</i> of Austria, and of most of Germany. They outnumber
all other clans. After them come the <i>Schultzes</i> and <i>Krauses</i>,
just as the <i>Joneses</i> and <i>Williamses</i> follow the <i>Smiths</i> in Great
Britain. <i>Schultze</i> and <i>Kraus</i> do not seem to be very common
names in New York, but <i>Schmidt</i>, <i>Muller</i>, <i>Schneider</i> and <i>Klein</i>
appear among the fifty commonest.<a name="FNanchor_6_426" id="FNanchor_6_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_426" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <i>Cohen</i> and <i>Levy</i> rank
eighth and ninth, and are both ahead of <i>Jones</i>, which is second
in England, and <i>Williams</i>, which is third. <i>Taylor</i>, a highly
typical British name, ranking fourth in England and Wales, is
twenty-third in New York. Ahead of it, beside <i>Murphy</i>, <i>Meyer</i>,
<i>Cohen</i> and <i>Levy</i>, are <i>Schmidt</i>, <i>Ryan</i>, <i>O'Brien</i>, <i>Kelly</i> and <i>Sullivan</i>.
<i>Robinson</i>, which is twelfth in England, is thirty-ninth in
New York; even <i>Schneider</i> and <i>Muller</i> are ahead of it. In Chicago
<i>Olson</i>, <i>Schmidt</i>, <i>Meyer</i>, <i>Hansen</i> and <i>Larsen</i> are ahead of
<i>Taylor</i>, and <i>Hoffman</i> and <i>Becker</i> are ahead of <i>Ward</i>; in Boston
<i>Sullivan</i> and <i>Murphy</i> are ahead of any English name save <i>Smith</i>;
in Philadelphia <i>Myers</i> is just below <i>Robinson</i>. Nor, as I have
said, is this large proliferation of foreign surnames confined to
the large cities. There are whole regions in the Southwest in
which <i>López</i> and <i>Gonzales</i> are far commoner names than <i>Smith</i>,
<i>Brown</i> or <i>Jones</i>, and whole regions in the Middle West wherein
<i>Olson</i> is commoner than either <i>Taylor</i> or <i>Williams</i>, and places
both North and South where <i>Duval</i> is at least as common as
<i>Brown</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover, the true proportions of this admixture of foreign
blood are partly concealed by a wholesale anglicization of surnames,
sometimes deliberate and sometimes the fruit of mere
confusion. That <i>Smith</i>, <i>Brown</i> and <i>Miller</i> remain in first, second
and third places among the surnames of New York is surely
no sound evidence of Anglo-Saxon survival. The German and <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg272"></a>[Pg272]</span>
Scandinavian <i>Schmidt</i> has undoubtedly contributed many a
<i>Smith</i>, and <i>Braun</i> many a <i>Brown</i>, and <i>Müller</i> many a <i>Miller</i>.
In the same way <i>Johnson</i>, which holds first place among Chicago
surnames, and <i>Anderson</i>, which holds third, are plainly reinforced
from Scandinavian sources, and the former may also owe
something to the Russian <i>Ivanof</i>. <i>Miller</i> is a relatively rare
name in England; it is not among the fifty most common. But
it stands thirtieth in Boston, fourth in New York and Baltimore,
and second in Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_7_427" id="FNanchor_7_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_427" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In the last-named city the
influence of <i>Müller</i>, probably borrowed from the Pennsylvania
Dutch, is plainly indicated, and in Chicago it is likely that there
are also contributions from the Scandinavian <i>Möller</i>, the Polish
<i>Jannszewski</i> and the Bohemian <i>Mlinár</i>. <i>Myers</i>, as we have seen,
is a common surname in Philadelphia. So are <i>Fox</i> and <i>Snyder</i>.
In some part, at least, they have been reinforced by the Pennsylvania
Dutch <i>Meyer</i>, <i>Fuchs</i> and <i>Schneider</i>. Sometimes <i>Müller</i>
changes to <i>Miller</i>, sometimes to <i>Muller</i>, and sometimes it remains
unchanged, but with the spelling made <i>Mueller</i>. <i>Muller</i> and
<i>Mueller</i> do not appear among the commoner names in Philadelphia;
all the <i>Müllers</i> seem to have become <i>Millers</i>, thus putting
<i>Miller</i> in second place. But in Chicago, with <i>Miller</i> in fourth
place, there is also <i>Mueller</i> in thirty-first place, and in New
York, with <i>Miller</i> in third place, there is also <i>Muller</i> in twenty-fourth
place.</p>

<p>Such changes, chiefly based upon transliterations, are met with
in all countries. The name of <i>Taaffe</i>, familiar in Austrian history,
had an Irish prototype, probably <i>Taft</i>. General <i>Demikof</i>,
one of the Russian commanders at the battle of Zorndorf, in
1758, was a Swede born <i>Themicoud</i>. Franz Maria von <i>Thugut</i>,
the Austrian diplomatist, was a member of an Italian Tyrolese
family named <i>Tunicotto</i>. This became <i>Thunichgut</i> (=<i>do no
good</i>) in Austria, and was changed to <i>Thugut</i> (=<i>do good</i>)
to bring it into greater accord with its possessor's deserts.<a name="FNanchor_8_428" id="FNanchor_8_428"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_428" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg273"></a>[Pg273]</span>
<i>Bonaparte</i> the Italian <i>buon(o)</i> became the French <i>bon</i>. Many
English surnames are decayed forms of Norman-French names,
for example, <i>Sidney</i> from <i>St. Denis</i>, <i>Divver</i> from <i>De Vere</i>,
<i>Bridgewater</i> from <i>Burgh de Walter</i>, <i>Montgomery</i> from <i>de Mungumeri</i>,
<i>Garnett</i> from <i>Guarinot</i>, and <i>Seymour</i> from <i>Saint-Maure</i>.
A large number of so-called Irish names are the products of
rough-and-ready transliterations of Gaelic patronymics, for example,
<i>Findlay</i> from <i>Fionnlagh</i>, <i>Dermott</i> from <i>Diarmuid</i>, and
<i>McLane</i> from <i>Mac Illeathiain</i>. In the same way the name of
<i>Phoenix</i> Park, in Dublin, came from <i>Fion Uisg</i> (=<i>fine water</i>).
Of late some of the more ardent Irish authors and politicians
have sought to return to the originals. Thus, <i>O'Sullivan</i> has
become <i>O Suilleabháin</i>, <i>Pearse</i> has become <i>Piarais</i>, <i>Mac Sweeney</i>
has become <i>Mac Suibhne</i>, and <i>Patrick</i> has suffered a widespread
transformation to <i>Padraic</i>. But in America, with a language
of peculiar vowel-sounds and even consonant-sounds struggling
against a foreign invasion unmatched for strength and variety,
such changes have been far more numerous than across the
ocean, and the legal rule of <i class="abblatin">idem sonans</i> is of much wider utility
than anywhere else in the world. If it were not for that rule
there would be endless difficulties for the <i>Wises</i> whose grandfathers
were <i>Weisses</i>, and the <i>Leonards</i> born <i>Leonhards</i>, <i>Leonhardts</i>
or <i>Lehnerts</i>, and the <i>Manneys</i> who descend and inherit
from <i>Le Maines</i>.</p>

<p>"A crude popular etymology," says a leading authority on
surnames,<a name="FNanchor_9_429" id="FNanchor_9_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_429" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "often begins to play upon a name that is no longer
significant to the many. So the <i>Thurgods</i> have become <i>Thoroughgoods</i>,
and the <i>Todenackers</i> have become the Pennsylvania
Dutch <i>Toothakers</i>, much as <i>asparagus</i> has become <i>sparrow-grass</i>."
So, too, the <i>Wittnachts</i> of Boyle county, Kentucky,
descendants of a Hollander, have become <i>Whitenecks</i>, and the
<i>Lehns</i> of lower Pennsylvania, descendants of some far-off German,
have become <i>Lanes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_430" id="FNanchor_10_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_430" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Edgar Allan <i>Poe</i> was a member of
a family long settled in Western Maryland, the founder being
one <i>Poh</i> or <i>Pfau</i>, a native of the Palatinate. Major George <span

<i>Armistead</i>, who defended Fort McHenry in 1814, when Francis
Scott Key wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner," was the descendant
of an <i>Armstädt</i> who came to Virginia from Hesse-Darmstadt.
General George A. <i>Custer</i>, the Indian fighter, was the great-grandson
of one <i>Küster</i>, a Hessian soldier paroled after Burgoyne's
surrender. William <i>Wirt</i>, anti-Masonic candidate for
the presidency in 1832, was the son of one <i>Wörth</i>. William
<i>Paca</i>, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was the great-grandson
of a Bohemian named <i>Paka</i>. General W. S. <i>Rosecrans</i>
was really a <i>Rosenkrantz</i>. Even the surname of Abraham <i>Lincoln</i>,
according to some authorities, was an anglicized form of
<i>Linkhorn</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_431" id="FNanchor_11_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_431" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Such changes, in fact, are almost innumerable; every work
upon American genealogy is full of examples. The first foreign
names to undergo the process were Dutch and French. Among
the former, <i>Reiger</i> was debased to <i>Riker</i>, <i>Van de Veer</i> to <i>Vandiver</i>,
<i>Van Huys</i> to <i>Vannice</i>, <i>Van Siegel</i> to <i>Van Sickle</i>, <i>Van
Arsdale</i> to <i>Vannersdale</i>, and <i>Haerlen</i> (or <i>Haerlem</i>) to <i>Harlan</i>;<a name="FNanchor_12_432" id="FNanchor_12_432"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_432" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
among the latter, <i>Petit</i> became <i>Poteet</i>, <i>Caillé</i> changed to
<i>Kyle</i>, <i>De la Haye</i> to <i>Dillehay</i>, <i>Dejean</i> to <i>Deshong</i>, <i>Guizot</i> to
<i>Gossett</i>, <i>Guereant</i> to <i>Caron</i>, <i>Soule</i> to <i>Sewell</i>, <i>Gervaise</i> to <i>Jarvis</i>,
<i>Bayle</i> to <i>Bailey</i>, <i>Fontaine</i> to <i>Fountain</i>, <i>Denis</i> to <i>Denny</i>, <i>Pebaudière</i>
to <i>Peabody</i>, <i>Bon Pas</i> to <i>Bumpus</i> and <i>de l'Hôtel</i> to <i>Doolittle</i>.
"Frenchmen and French Canadians who came to New
England," says Schele de Vere, "had to pay for such hospitality
as they there received by the sacrifice of their names.
The brave <i>Bon Coeur</i>, Captain Marryatt tells us in his Diary,
became Mr. <i>Bunker</i>, and gave his name to Bunker's Hill."<a name="FNanchor_13_433" id="FNanchor_13_433"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13_433" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
But it was the German immigration that provoked the first
really wholesale slaughter. A number of characteristic German
sounds—for example, that of <i>ü</i> and the guttural in <i>ch</i> and <i>g</i>—are
almost impossible to the Anglo-Saxon pharynx, and so they
had to go. Thus, <i>Bloch</i> was changed to <i>Block</i> or <i>Black</i>, <i>Ochs</i> to <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg275"></a>[Pg275]</span>
<i>Oakes</i>, <i>Hock</i> to <i>Hoke</i>, <i>Fischbach</i> to <i>Fishback</i>, <i>Albrecht</i> to <i>Albert</i>
or <i>Albright</i>, and <i>Steinweg</i> to <i>Steinway</i>, and the <i>Grundwort</i>, <i>bach</i>,
was almost universally changed to <i>baugh</i>, as in <i>Brumbaugh</i>.
The <i>ü</i> met the same fate: <i>Grün</i> was changed to <i>Green</i>, <i>Führ</i>
to <i>Fear</i> or <i>Fuhr</i>, <i>Wärner</i> to <i>Warner</i>, <i>Düring</i> to <i>Deering</i>, and
<i>Schnäbele</i> to <i>Snavely</i>, <i>Snabely</i> or <i>Snively</i>. In many other cases
there were changes in spelling to preserve vowel sounds differently
represented in German and English. Thus, <i>Blum</i> was
changed to <i>Bloom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_434" id="FNanchor_14_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_434" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, <i>Reuss</i> to <i>Royce</i>, <i>Koester</i> to <i>Kester</i>, <i>Kuehle</i>
to <i>Keeley</i>, <i>Schroeder</i> to <i>Schrader</i>, <i>Stehli</i> to <i>Staley</i>, <i>Weymann</i> to
<i>Wayman</i>, <i>Friedmann</i> to <i>Freedman</i>, <i>Bauman</i> to <i>Bowman</i>, and
<i>Lang</i> (as the best compromise possible) to <i>Long</i>. The change
of <i>Oehm</i> to <i>Ames</i> belongs to the same category; the addition of
the final <i>s</i> represents a typical effort to substitute the nearest
related Anglo-Saxon name. Other examples of that effort are
to be found in <i>Michaels</i> for <i>Michaelis</i>, <i>Bowers</i> for <i>Bauer</i>, <i>Johnson</i>
for <i>Johannsen</i>, <i>Ford</i> for <i>Furth</i>, <i>Hines</i> for <i>Heintz</i>, <i>Kemp</i> for
<i>Kempf</i>, <i>Foreman</i> for <i>Fuhrmann</i>, <i>Kuhns</i> or <i>Coons</i> for <i>Kuntz</i>,
<i>Hoover</i> for <i>Huber</i>, <i>Levering</i> for <i>Liebering</i>, <i>Jones</i> for <i>Jonas</i>,
<i>Swope</i> for <i>Schwab</i>, <i>Hite</i> or <i>Hyde</i> for <i>Heid</i>, <i>Andrews</i> for <i>André</i>,
<i>Young</i> for <i>Jung</i>, and <i>Pence</i> for <i>Pentz</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_435" id="FNanchor_15_435"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15_435" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The American antipathy to accented letters, mentioned in the
chapter on spelling, is particularly noticeable among surnames.
An immigrant named <i>Fürst</i> inevitably becomes plain <i>Furst</i> in
the United States, and if not the man, then surely his son.
<i>Löwe</i>, in the same way, is transformed into <i>Lowe</i> (pro. <i>low</i>),<a name="FNanchor_16_436" id="FNanchor_16_436"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_436" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg276"></a>[Pg276]</span>
<i>Lürmann</i> into <i>Lurman</i>, <i>Schön</i> into <i>Schon</i>, <i>Suplée</i> into <i>Suplee</i>
or <i>Supplee</i>, <i>Lüders</i> into <i>Luders</i> and <i>Brühl</i> into <i>Brill</i>. Even
when no accent betrays it, the foreign diphthong is under hard
pressure. Thus the German <i>oe</i> disappears, and <i>Loeb</i> is changed
to <i>Lobe</i> or <i>Laib</i>, <i>Oehler</i> to <i>Ohler</i>, <i>Loeser</i> to <i>Leser</i>, and <i>Schoen</i>
to <i>Schon</i> or <i>Shane</i>. In the same way the <i>au</i> in such names as
<i>Rosenau</i> changes to <i>aw</i>. So too, the French <i>oi</i>-sound is disposed
of, and <i>Dubois</i> is pronounced <i>Doo-bóys</i>, and <i>Boileau</i> acquires
a first syllable rhyming with <i>toil</i>. So with the <i>kn</i> in the
German names of the <i>Knapp</i> class; they are all pronounced,
probably by analogy with <i>Knight</i>, as if they began with <i>n</i>. So
with <i>sch</i>; <i>Schneider</i> becomes <i>Snyder</i>, <i>Schlegel</i> becomes <i>Slagel</i>,
and <i>Schluter</i> becomes <i>Sluter</i>. If a foreigner clings to the original
spelling of his name he must usually expect to hear it mispronounced.
<i>Roth</i>, in American, quickly becomes <i>Rawth</i>; <i>Frémont</i>,
losing both accent and the French <i>e</i>, become <i>Freemont</i>;
<i>Blum</i> begins to rhyme with <i>dumb</i>; <i>Mann</i> rhymes with <i>van</i>, and
<i>Lang</i> with <i>hang</i>; <i>Krantz</i>, <i>Lantz</i> and their cognates with <i>chance</i>;
<i>Kurtz</i> with <i>shirts</i>; the first syllable of <i>Gutmann</i> with <i>but</i>; the
first of <i>Kahler</i> with <i>bay</i>; the first of <i>Werner</i> with <i>turn</i>; the
first of <i>Wagner</i> with <i>nag</i>. <i>Uhler</i>, in America, is always <i>Youler</i>.
<i>Berg</i> loses its German <i>e</i>-sound for an English <i>u</i>-sound, and its
German hard <i>g</i> for an English <i>g</i>; it becomes identical with the
<i>berg</i> of <i>iceberg</i>. The same change in the vowel occurs in <i>Erdmann</i>.
In <i>König</i> the German diphthong succumbs to a long
<i>o</i>, and the hard <i>g</i> becomes <i>k</i>; the common pronunciation is
<i>Cone-ik</i>. Often, in <i>Berger</i>, the <i>g</i> becomes soft, and the name
rhymes with <i>verger</i>. It becomes soft, too, in <i>Bittinger</i>. In
<i>Wilstach</i> and <i>Welsbach</i> the <i>ch</i> becomes a <i>k</i>. In <i>Anheuser</i> the
<i>eu</i> changes to a long <i>i</i>. The final <i>e</i>, important in German, is
nearly always silenced; <i>Dohme</i> rhymes with <i>foam</i>; <i>Kühne</i> becomes
<i>Keen</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to these transliterations, there are constant translations
of foreign proper names. "Many a Pennsylvania <i>Carpenter</i>,"
says Dr. Oliphant,<a name="FNanchor_17_437" id="FNanchor_17_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_437" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "bearing a surname that is English,
from the French, from the Latin, and there a Celtic loan-word <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg277"></a>[Pg277]</span>
in origin, is neither English, nor French, nor Latin, nor
Celt, but an original German <i>Zimmermann</i>."<a name="FNanchor_18_438" id="FNanchor_18_438"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_438" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A great many
other such translations are under everyday observation. <i>Pfund</i>
becomes <i>Pound</i>; <i>Becker</i>, <i>Baker</i>; <i>Schumacher</i>, <i>Shoemaker</i>; <i>König</i>,
<i>King</i>; <i>Weisberg</i>, <i>Whitehill</i>; <i>Koch</i>, <i>Cook</i>;<a name="FNanchor_19_439" id="FNanchor_19_439"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_439" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> <i>Neuman</i>, <i>Newman</i>;
<i>Schaefer</i>, <i>Shepherd</i> or <i>Sheppard</i>; <i>Gutmann</i>, <i>Goodman</i>; <i>Goldschmidt</i>,
<i>Goldsmith</i>; <i>Edelstein</i>, <i>Noblestone</i>; <i>Steiner</i>, <i>Stoner</i>;
<i>Meister</i>, <i>Master(s)</i>; <i>Schwartz</i>, <i>Black</i>; <i>Weiss</i>, <i>White</i>; <i>Weber</i>,
<i>Weaver</i>; <i>Bucher</i>, <i>Booker</i>; <i>Vogelgesang</i>, <i>Birdsong</i>; <i>Sontag</i>, <i>Sunday</i>,
and so on. Partial translations are also encountered, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>Studebaker</i> from <i>Studebecker</i>, and <i>Reindollar</i> from <i>Rheinthaler</i>.
By the same process, among the newer immigrants, the Polish
<i>Wilkiewicz</i> becomes <i>Wilson</i>, the Bohemian <i>Bohumil</i> becomes
<i>Godfrey</i>, and the Bohemian <i>Kovár</i> and the Russian <i>Kuznetzov</i>
become <i>Smith</i>. Some curious examples are occasionally encountered.
Thus Henry <i>Woodhouse</i>, a gentleman prominent in
aeronautical affairs, came to the United States from Italy as
Mario Terenzio Enrico <i>Casalegno</i>; his new surname is simply
a translation of his old one. And the <i>Belmonts</i>, the bankers,
unable to find a euphonious English equivalent for their German-Jewish
patronymic of <i>Schönberg</i>, chose a French one that Americans
could pronounce.</p>

<p>In part, as I say, these changes in surname are enforced by
the sheer inability of Americans to pronounce certain Continental
consonants, and their disinclination to remember the
Continental vowel sounds. Many an immigrant, finding his
name constantly mispronounced, changes its vowels or drops
some of its consonants; many another shortens it, or translates
it, or changes it entirely for the same reason. Just as a well-known
Graeco-French poet changed his Greek name of <i>Papadiamantopoulos</i>
to <i>Moréas</i> because <i>Papadiamantopoulos</i> was too
much for Frenchmen, and as an eminent Polish-English novelist <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg278"></a>[Pg278]</span>
changed his Polish name of <i>Korzeniowski</i> to <i>Conrad</i> because few
Englishmen could pronounce <i>owski</i> correctly, so the Italian or
Greek or Slav immigrant, coming up for naturalization, very
often sheds his family name with his old allegiance, and emerges
as <i>Taylor</i>, <i>Jackson</i> or <i>Wilson</i>. I once encountered a firm of
Polish Jews, showing the name of <i>Robinson &#38; Jones</i> on its sign-board,
whose partners were born <i>Rubinowitz</i> and <i>Jonas</i>. I lately
heard of a German named <i>Knoche</i>—a name doubly difficult to
Americans, what with the <i>kn</i> and the <i>ch</i>—who changed it boldly
to <i>Knox</i> to avoid being called <i>Nokky</i>. A Greek named <i>Zoyiopoulous</i>,
<i>Kolokotronis</i>, <i>Mavrokerdatos</i> or <i>Constantinopolous</i>
would find it practically impossible to carry on amicable business
with Americans; his name would arouse their mirth, if not their
downright ire. And the same burden would lie upon a Hungarian
named <i>Beniczkyné</i> or <i>Gyalui</i>, or <i>Szilagyi</i>, or <i>Vezercsillagok</i>.
Or a Finn named <i>Kyyhkysen</i>, or <i>Jääskelainen</i>, or <i>Tuulensuu</i>,
or <i>Uotinen</i>,—all honorable Finnish patronymics. Or a
Swede named <i>Sjogren</i>, or <i>Schjtt</i>, or <i>Leijonhufvud</i>. Or a Bohemian
named <i>Srb</i>, or <i>Hrubka</i>. Or, for that matter, a German
named <i>Kannengiesser</i>, or <i>Schnapaupf</i>, or <i>Pfannenbecker</i>.</p>

<p>But more important than this purely linguistic hostility, there
is a deeper social enmity, and it urges the immigrant to change
his name with even greater force. For a hundred years past all
the heaviest and most degrading labor of the United States has
been done by successive armies of foreigners, and so a concept
of inferiority has come to be attached to mere foreignness. In
addition, these newcomers, pressing upward steadily in the manner
already described, have offered the native a formidable,
and considering their lower standards of living, what has appeared
to him to be an unfair competition on his own plane, and
as a result a hatred born of disastrous rivalry has been added to
his disdain. Our unmatchable vocabulary of derisive names for
foreigners reveals the national attitude. The French <i>boche</i>, the
German <i>hunyadi</i> (for Hungarian),<a name="FNanchor_20_440" id="FNanchor_20_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_440" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and the old English <i>froggy</i>
(for Frenchman) seem lone and feeble beside our great repertoire: <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg279"></a>[Pg279]</span>
<i>dago</i>, <i>wop</i>, <i>guinea</i>, <i>kike</i>, <i>goose</i>, <i>mick</i>, <i>harp</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21_441" id="FNanchor_21_441"></a><a
href="#Footnote_21_441" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> <i>bohick</i>, <i>bohunk</i>,
<i>square-head</i>, <i>greaser</i>, <i>canuck</i>, <i>spiggoty</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_442" id="FNanchor_22_442"></a><a
href="#Footnote_22_442" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> <i>chink</i>, <i>polack</i>,
<i>dutchie</i>, <i>scowegian</i>, <i>hunkie</i> and <i>yellow-belly</i>. This disdain tends
to pursue an immigrant with extraordinary rancor when he
bears a name that is unmistakably foreign and hence difficult
to the native, and open to his crude burlesque. Moreover, the
general feeling penetrates the man himself, particularly if he
be ignorant, and he comes to believe that his name is not only a
handicap, but also intrinsically discreditable—that it wars subtly
upon his worth and integrity.<a name="FNanchor_23_443" id="FNanchor_23_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_443" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This feeling, perhaps, accounted
for a good many changes of surnames among Germans upon the
entrance of the United States into the war. But in the majority
of cases, of course, the changes so copiously reported—<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, from
<i>Bielefelder</i> to <i>Benson</i>, and from <i>Pulvermacher</i> to <i>Pullman</i>—were
merely efforts at protective coloration. The immigrant, in
a time of extraordinary suspicion and difficulty, tried to get rid
of at least one handicap.<a name="FNanchor_24_444" id="FNanchor_24_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_444" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg280"></a>[Pg280]</span></p>

<p>This motive constantly appears among the Jews, who face an
anti-Semitism that is imperfectly concealed and may be expected
to grow stronger hereafter. Once they have lost the faith of
their fathers, a phenomenon almost inevitable in the first native-born
generation, they shrink from all the disadvantages that go
with Jewishness, and seek to conceal their origin, or, at all
events, to avoid making it unnecessarily noticeable.<a name="FNanchor_25_445" id="FNanchor_25_445"></a><a
href="#Footnote_25_445" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> To this
end they modify the spelling of the more familiar Jewish surnames,
turning <i>Levy</i> into <i>Lewy</i>, <i>Lewyt</i>, <i>Levitt</i>, <i>Levin</i>, <i>Levine</i>,
<i>Levey</i>, <i>Levie</i><a name="FNanchor_26_446" id="FNanchor_26_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_446" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and even <i>Lever</i>, <i>Cohen</i> into <i>Cohn</i>, <i>Cahn</i>, <i>Kahn</i>,
<i>Kann</i>, <i>Coyne</i> and <i>Conn</i>, <i>Aarons</i> into <i>Arens</i> and <i>Ahrens</i> and
<i>Solomon</i> into <i>Salmon</i>, <i>Salomon</i> and <i>Solmson</i>. In the same way
they shorten their long names, changing <i>Wolfsheimer</i> to <i>Wolf</i>,
<i>Goldschmidt</i> to <i>Gold</i>, and <i>Rosenblatt</i>, <i>Rosenthal</i>, <i>Rosenbaum</i>, <i>Rosenau</i>,
<i>Rosenberg</i>, <i>Rosenbusch</i>, <i>Rosenblum</i>, <i>Rosenstein</i>, <i>Rosenheim</i>
and <i>Rosenfeldt</i> to <i>Rose</i>. Like the Germans, they also seek
refuge in translations more or less literal. Thus, on the East
Side of New York, <i>Blumenthal</i> is often changed to <i>Bloomingdale</i>,
<i>Schneider</i> to <i>Taylor</i>, <i>Reichman</i> to <i>Richman</i>, and <i>Schlachtfeld</i> to
<i>Warfield</i>. <i>Fiddler</i>, a common Jewish name, becomes <i>Harper</i>;
so does <i>Pikler</i>, which is Yiddish for <i>drummer</i>. <i>Stolar</i>, which is
a Yiddish word borrowed from the Russian, signifying <i>carpenter</i>,
is often changed to <i>Carpenter</i>. <i>Lichtman</i> and <i>Lichtenstein</i>
become <i>Chandler</i>. <i>Meilach</i>, which is Hebrew for <i>king</i>, becomes
<i>King</i>, and so does <i>Meilachson</i>. The strong tendency to seek
English-sounding equivalents for names of noticeably foreign
origin changes <i>Sher</i> into <i>Sherman</i>, <i>Michel</i> into <i>Mitchell</i>, <i>Rogowsky</i>
into <i>Rogers</i>, <i>Kolinsky</i> into <i>Collins</i>, <i>Rabinovitch</i> into <i>Robbins</i>,
<i>Davidovitch</i> into <i>Davis</i>, <i>Moiseyev</i> into <i>Macy</i> or <i>Mason</i>, and
<i>Jacobson</i>, <i>Jacobovitch</i> and <i>Jacobovsky</i> into <i>Jackson</i>. This last <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg281"></a>[Pg281]</span>
change proceeds by way of a transient change to <i>Jake</i> or <i>Jack</i>
as a nickname. <i>Jacob</i> is always abbreviated to one or the other
on the East Side. <i>Yankelevitch</i> also becomes <i>Jackson</i>, for <i>Yankel</i>
is Yiddish for <i>Jacob</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27_447" id="FNanchor_27_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_447" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Among the immigrants of other stocks some extraordinarily
radical changes in name are to be observed. Greek names of
five, and even eight syllables shrink to <i>Smith</i>; Hungarian names
that seem to be all consonants are reborn in such euphonious
forms as <i>Martin</i> and <i>Lacy</i>. I have encountered a <i>Gregory</i> who
was born <i>Grgurevich</i> in Serbia; a <i>Uhler</i> who was born <i>Uhlyarik</i>;
a <i>Graves</i> who descends from the fine old Dutch family of <i>'sGravenhage</i>.
I once knew a man named <i>Lawton</i> whose grandfather
had been a <i>Lautenberger</i>. First he shed the <i>berger</i> and then
he changed the spelling of <i>Lauten</i> to make it fit the inevitable
American mispronunciation. There is, again, a family of <i>Dicks</i>
in the South whose ancestor was a <i>Schwettendieck</i>—apparently
a Dutch or Low German name. There is, yet again, a celebrated
American artist, of the Bohemian patronymic of <i>Hrubka</i>, who
has abandoned it for a surname which is common to all the
Teutonic languages, and is hence easy for Americans. The
Italians, probably because of the relations established by the
Catholic church, often take Irish names, as they marry Irish
girls; it is common to hear of an Italian pugilist or politician
named <i>Kelly</i> or <i>O'Brien</i>. The process of change is often informal,
but even legally it is quite facile. The Naturalization
Act of June 29, 1906, authorizes the court, as a part of the
naturalization of any alien, to make an order changing his name.
This is frequently done when he receives his last papers; sometimes,
if the newspapers are to be believed, without his solicitation,
and even against his protest. If the matter is overlooked
at the time, he may change his name later on, like any other
citizen, by simple application to a court of record.</p>

<p>Among names of Anglo-Saxon origin and names naturalized
long before the earliest colonization, one notes certain American
peculiarities, setting off the nomenclature of the United States <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg282"></a>[Pg282]</span>
from that of the mother country. The relative infrequency of
hyphenated names in America is familiar; when they appear at
all it is almost always in response to direct English influences.<a name="FNanchor_28_448" id="FNanchor_28_448"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_448" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Again, a number of English family names have undergone
modification in the New World. <i>Venable</i> may serve as a specimen.
The form in England is almost invariably <i>Venables</i>, but
in America the final <i>s</i> has been lost, and every example of the
name that I have been able to find in the leading American
reference-books is without it. And where spellings have remained
unchanged, pronunciations have been frequently modified.
This is particularly noticeable in the South. <i>Callowhill</i>,
down there, is commonly pronounced <i>Carrol</i>; <i>Crenshawe</i> is
<i>Granger</i>; <i>Hawthorne</i>, <i>Horton</i>; <i>Heyward</i>, <i>Howard</i>; <i>Norsworthy</i>,
<i>Nazary</i>; <i>Ironmonger</i>, <i>Munger</i>; <i>Farinholt</i>, <i>Fernall</i>; <i>Camp</i>, <i>Kemp</i>;
<i>Buchanan</i>, <i>Bohannan</i>; <i>Drewry</i>, <i>Droit</i>; <i>Enroughty</i>, <i>Darby</i>; and
<i>Taliaferro</i>, <i>Tolliver</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_449" id="FNanchor_29_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_449" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The English <i>Crowninshields</i> pronounce
every syllable of their name; the American <i>Crowninshields</i> commonly
make it <i>Crunshel</i>. <i>Van Schaick</i>, an old New York name,
is pronounced <i>Von Scoik</i>. A good many American Jews, aiming
at a somewhat laborious refinement, change the pronunciation
of the terminal <i>stein</i> in their names so that it rhymes, not
with <i>line</i>, but with <i>bean</i>. Thus, in fashionable Jewish circles,
there are no longer any <i>Epsteins</i>, <i>Goldsteins</i> and <i>Hammersteins</i>
but only <i>Epsteens</i>, <i>Goldsteens</i> and <i>Hammersteens</i>. The
American Jews differ further from the English in pronouncing
<i>Levy</i> to make the first syllable rhyme with <i>tea</i>; the
English Jews always make the name <i>Lev-vy</i>. To match such <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg283"></a>[Pg283]</span>
American prodigies as <i>Darby</i> for <i>Enroughty</i>, the English themselves
have <i>Hools</i> for <i>Howells</i>, <i>Sillinger</i> for <i>St. Leger</i>, <i>Sinjin</i>
for <i>St. John</i>, <i>Pool</i> for <i>Powell</i>, <i>Weems</i> for <i>Wemyss</i>, <i>Kerduggen</i>
for <i>Cadogen</i>, <i>Mobrer</i> for <i>Marlborough</i>, <i>Key</i> for <i>Cains</i>, <i>Marchbanks</i>
for <i>Marjoribanks</i>, <i>Beecham</i> for <i>Beauchamp</i>, <i>Chumley</i> for
<i>Cholmondeley</i>, <i>Trosley</i> for <i>Trotterscliffe</i>, and <i>Darby</i> for <i>Derby</i>,
not to mention <i>Maudlin</i> for <i>Magdalen</i>.</p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 2</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Given_Names"></a>Given Names</h3>—The non-Anglo Saxon American's willingness
to anglicize his patronymic is far exceeded by his eagerness to
give "American" baptismal names to his children. The favorite
given names of the old country almost disappear in the
first native-born generation. The Irish immigrants quickly
dropped such names as <i>Terence</i>, <i>Dennis</i> and <i>Patrick</i>, and adopted
in their places the less conspicuous <i>John</i>, <i>George</i> and <i>William</i>.
The Germans, in the same way, abandoned <i>Otto</i>, <i>August</i>, <i>Hermann</i>,
<i>Ludwig</i>, <i>Heinrich</i>, <i>Wolfgang</i>, <i>Albrecht</i>, <i>Wilhelm</i>, <i>Kurt</i>,
<i>Hans</i>, <i>Rudolf</i>, <i>Gottlieb</i>, <i>Johann</i> and <i>Franz</i>. For some of these
they substituted the English equivalents: <i>Charles</i>, <i>Lewis</i>, <i>Henry</i>,
<i>William</i>, <i>John</i>, <i>Frank</i> and so on. In the room of others they
began afflicting their offspring with more fanciful native names:
<i>Milton</i> and <i>Raymond</i> were their chief favorites thirty or forty
years ago.<a name="FNanchor_30_450" id="FNanchor_30_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_450" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The Jews carry the thing to great lengths. At
present they seem to take most delight in <i>Sidney</i>, <i>Irving</i>, <i>Milton</i>,
<i>Roy</i>, <i>Stanley</i> and <i>Monroe</i>, but they also call their sons <i>John</i>,
<i>Charles</i>, <i>Henry</i>, <i>Harold</i>, <i>William</i>, <i>Richard</i>, <i>James</i>, <i>Albert</i>, <i>Edward</i>,
<i>Alfred</i>, <i>Frederick</i>, <i>Thomas</i>, and even <i>Mark</i>, <i>Luke</i> and
<i>Matthew</i>, and their daughters <i>Mary</i>, <i>Gertrude</i>, <i>Estelle</i>, <i>Pauline</i>,
<i>Alice</i> and <i>Edith</i>. As a boy I went to school with many Jewish
boys. The commonest given names among them were <i>Isadore</i>,
<i>Samuel</i>, <i>Jonas</i>, <i>Isaac</i> and <i>Israel</i>. These are seldom bestowed by <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg284"></a>[Pg284]</span>
the rabbis of today. In the same school were a good many German
pupils, boy and girl. Some of the girls bore such fine old
German given names as <i>Katharina</i>, <i>Wilhelmina</i>, <i>Elsa</i>, <i>Lotta</i>,
<i>Ermentrude</i> and <i>Frankziska</i>. All these have begun to disappear.</div>

<p>The newer immigrants, indeed, do not wait for the birth of
children to demonstrate their naturalization; they change their
own given names immediately they land. I am told by Abraham
Cahan that this is done almost universally on the East Side
of New York. "Even the most old-fashioned Jews immigrating
to this country," he says, "change <i>Yosel</i> to <i>Joseph</i>, <i>Yankel</i> to
<i>Jacob</i>, <i>Liebel</i> to <i>Louis</i>, <i>Feivel</i> to <i>Philip</i>, <i>Itzik</i> to <i>Isaac</i>, <i>Ruven</i> to
<i>Robert</i>, and <i>Moise</i> or <i>Motel</i> to <i>Morris</i>." Moreover, the spelling
of <i>Morris</i>, as the position of its bearer improves, commonly
changes to <i>Maurice</i>, though the pronunciation may remain
<i>Mawruss</i>, as in the case of Mr. Perlmutter. The immigrants of
other stocks follow the same habit. Every Bohemian <i>Vaclav</i> or
<i>Vojtĕch</i> becomes a <i>William</i>, every <i>Jaroslav</i> becomes a <i>Jerry</i>,
every <i>Bronislav</i> a <i>Barney</i>, and every <i>Stanislav</i> a <i>Stanley</i>. The
Italians run to <i>Frank</i> and <i>Joe</i>; so do the Hungarians and the
Balkan peoples; the Russians quickly drop their national system
of nomenclature and give their children names according to the
American plan. Even the Chinese laundrymen of the big cities
become <i>John</i>, <i>George</i>, <i>Charlie</i> and <i>Frank</i>; I once encountered one
boasting the name of <i>Emil</i>.</p>

<p>The Puritan influence, in names as in ideas, has remained a
good deal more potent in American than in England. The given
name of the celebrated <i>Praise-God</i> Barebones marked a fashion
which died out in England very quickly, but one still finds traces
of it in America, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, in such women's names as <i>Faith</i>, <i>Hope</i>,
<i>Prudence</i>, <i>Charity</i> and <i>Mercy</i>, and in such men's names as <i>Peregrine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_31_451" id="FNanchor_31_451"></a><a
href="#Footnote_31_451" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The religious obsession of the New England colonists is
also kept in mind by the persistence of Biblical names: <i>Ezra</i>,
<i>Hiram</i>, <i>Ezekial</i>, <i>Zachariah</i>, <i>Elijah</i>, <i>Elihu</i>, and so on. These <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg285"></a>[Pg285]</span>
names excite the derision of the English; an American comic
character, in an English play or novel, always bears one of them.
Again, the fashion of using surnames as given names is far more
widespread in America than in England. In this country, indeed,
it takes on the character of a national habit; fully three out
of four eldest sons, in families of any consideration, bear their
mothers' surnames as middle names. This fashion arose in England
during the seventeenth century, and one of its fruits was
the adoption of such well-known surnames as <i>Stanley</i>, <i>Cecil</i>, <i>Howard</i>,
<i>Douglas</i> and <i>Duncan</i> as common given names.<a name="FNanchor_32_452" id="FNanchor_32_452"></a><a
href="#Footnote_32_452" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It died out
over there during the eighteenth century, and today the great
majority of Englishmen bear such simple given names as <i>John</i>,
<i>Charles</i> and <i>William</i>—often four or five of them—but in America
it has persisted. A glance at a roster of the Presidents of the
United States will show how firmly it has taken root. Of the ten
that have had middle names at all, six have had middle names
that were family surnames, and two of the six have dropped their
other given names and used these surnames. This custom, perhaps,
has paved the way for another: that of making given names
of any proper nouns that happen to strike the fancy. Thus
General Sherman was named after an Indian chief, <i>Tecumseh</i>,
and a Chicago judge was baptized <i>Kenesaw Mountain</i><a name="FNanchor_33_453" id="FNanchor_33_453"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_453" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in memory
of the battle that General Sherman fought there. A late
candidate for governor of New York had the curious given name
of <i>D-Cady</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34_454" id="FNanchor_34_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_454" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Various familiar American given names, originally
surnames, are almost unknown in England, among them, <i>Washington</i>,
<i>Jefferson</i>, <i>Jackson</i>, <i>Lincoln</i>, <i>Columbus</i> and <i>Lee</i>. <i>Chauncey</i>
forms a curious addition to the list. It was the surname of
the second president of Harvard College, and was bestowed upon
their offspring by numbers of his graduates. It then got into <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg286"></a>[Pg286]</span>
general use and acquired a typically American pronunciation,
with the <i>a</i> of the first syllable flat. It is never encountered in
England.</p>

<p>In the pronunciation of various given names, as in that of
many surnames, English and American usages differ. <i>Evelyn</i>,
in England, is given two syllables instead of three, and the first
is made to rhyme with <i>leave</i>. <i>Irene</i> is given two syllables, making
it <i>Irene-y</i>. <i>Ralph</i> is pronounced <i>Rafe</i>. <i>Jerome</i> is accented on
the first syllable; in America it is always accented on the second.<a name="FNanchor_35_455" id="FNanchor_35_455"></a><a

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Geographical_Names"></a>Geographical Names</h3>—"There is no part of the world," said
Robert Louis Stevenson, "where nomenclature is so rich, poetical,
humorous and picturesque as in the United States of America."
A glance at the latest United States Official Postal Guide<a name="FNanchor_36_456" id="FNanchor_36_456"></a><a
href="#Footnote_36_456" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> or
report of the United States Geographic Board<a name="FNanchor_37_457" id="FNanchor_37_457"></a><a
href="#Footnote_37_457" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> quite bears out
this opinion. The map of the country is besprinkled with place
names from at least half a hundred languages, living and dead,
and among them one finds examples of the most daring and elaborate
fancy. There are Spanish, French and Indian names as
melodious and charming as running water; there are names out
of the histories and mythologies of all the great races of man;
there are names grotesque and names almost sublime. No other
country can match them for interest and variety. When there
arises among us a philologist who will study them as thoroughly
and intelligently as the Swiss, Johann Jakob Egli, studied the
place names of Central Europe, his work will be an invaluable
contribution to the history of the nation, and no less to an understanding
of the psychology of its people.</div>

<p>The original English settlers, it would appear, displayed little
imagination in naming the new settlements and natural features <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg287"></a>[Pg287]</span>
of the land that they came to. Their almost invariable tendency,
at the start, was to make use of names familiar at home, or to
invent banal compounds. <i>Plymouth Rock</i> at the North and
<i>Jamestown</i> at the South are examples of their poverty of fancy;
they filled the narrow tract along the coast with new <i>Bostons</i>,
<i>Cambridges</i>, <i>Bristols</i> and <i>Londons</i>, and often used the adjective
as a prefix. But this was only in the days of beginning. Once
they had begun to move back from the coast and to come into
contact with the aborigines and with the widely dispersed settlers
of other races, they encountered rivers, mountains, lakes and even
towns that bore far more engaging names, and these, after some
resistance, they perforce adopted. The native names of such
rivers as the <i>James</i>, the <i>York</i> and the <i>Charles</i> succumbed, but
those of the <i>Potomac</i>, the <i>Patapsco</i>, the <i>Merrimack</i> and the <i>Penobscot</i>
survived, and they were gradually reinforced as the country
was penetrated. Most of these Indian names, in getting upon
the early maps, suffered somewhat severe simplifications. <i>Potowánmeac</i>
was reduced to <i>Potomack</i> and then to <i>Potomac</i>; <i>Unéaukara</i>
became <i>Niagara</i>; <i>Reckawackes</i>, by the law of Hobson-Jobson,
was turned into <i>Rockaway</i>, and <i>Pentapang</i> into <i>Port Tobacco</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38_458" id="FNanchor_38_458"></a><a
href="#Footnote_38_458" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
But, despite such elisions and transformations, the charm of thousands
of them remained, and today they are responsible for much
of the characteristic color of American geographical nomenclature.
Such names as <i>Tallahassee</i>, <i>Susquehanna</i>, <i>Mississippi</i>,
<i>Allegheny</i>, <i>Chicago</i>, <i>Kennebec</i>, <i>Patuxent</i> and <i>Arkansas</i> give a
barbaric brilliancy to the American map. Only the map of
Australia, with its mellifluous Maori names, can match it.</p>

<p>The settlement of the American continent, once the eastern
coast ranges were crossed, proceeded with unparalleled speed,
and so the naming of the new rivers, lakes, peaks and valleys,
and of the new towns and districts no less, strained the inventiveness
of the pioneers. The result is the vast duplication of names
that shows itself in the Postal Guide. No less than eighteen imitative <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg288"></a>[Pg288]</span>
<i>Bostons</i> and <i>New Bostons</i> still appear, and there are nineteen
<i>Bristols</i>, twenty-eight <i>Newports</i>, and twenty-two <i>Londons</i>
and <i>New Londons</i>. Argonauts starting out from an older settlement
on the coast would take its name with them, and so we find
<i>Philadelphias</i> in Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee,
<i>Richmonds</i> in Iowa, Kansas and nine other western states, and
<i>Princetons</i> in fifteen. Even when a new name was hit upon it
seems to have been hit upon simultaneously by scores of scattered
bands of settlers; thus we find the whole land bespattered with
<i>Washingtons</i>, <i>Lafayettes</i>, <i>Jeffersons</i> and <i>Jacksons</i>, and with
names suggested by common and obvious natural objects, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
<i>Bear Creek</i>, <i>Bald Knob</i> and <i>Buffalo</i>. The Geographic Board,
in its last report, made a belated protest against this excessive
duplication. "The names <i>Elk</i>, <i>Beaver</i>, <i>Cottonwood</i> and <i>Bald</i>,"
it said, "are altogether too numerous."<a name="FNanchor_39_459" id="FNanchor_39_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_459" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Of postoffices alone
there are fully a hundred embodying <i>Elk</i>; counting in rivers,
lakes, creeks, mountains and valleys, the map of the United
States probably shows at least twice as many such names.</p>

<p>A study of American geographical and place names reveals
eight general classes, as follows: (<i>a</i>) those embodying personal
names, chiefly the surnames of pioneers or of national heroes;
(<i>b</i>) those transferred from other and older places, either in the
eastern states or in Europe; (<i>c</i>) Indian names; (<i>d</i>) Dutch, Spanish
and French names; (<i>e</i>) Biblical and mythological names;
(<i>f</i>) names descriptive of localities; (<i>g</i>) names suggested by the
local flora, fauna or geology; (<i>h</i>) purely fanciful names. The
names of the first class are perhaps the most numerous. Some
consist of surnames standing alone, as <i>Washington</i>, <i>Cleveland</i>,
<i>Bismarck</i>, <i>Lafayette</i>, <i>Taylor</i> and <i>Randolph</i>; others consist of surnames
in combination with various old and new <i>Grundwörter</i>,
as <i>Pittsburgh</i>, <i>Knoxville</i>, <i>Bailey's Switch</i>, <i>Hagerstown</i>, <i>Franklinton</i>,
<i>Dodge City</i>, <i>Fort Riley</i>, <i>Wayne Junction</i> and <i>McKeesport</i>;
and yet others are contrived of given names, either alone
or in combination, as <i>Louisville</i>, <i>St. Paul</i>, <i>Elizabeth</i>, <i>Johnstown</i>,
<i>Charlotte</i>, <i>Williamsburg</i> and <i>Marysville</i>. The number of towns
in the United States bearing women's given names is enormous. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg289"></a>[Pg289]</span>
I find, for example, eleven postoffices called <i>Charlotte</i>, ten called
<i>Ada</i> and no less than nineteen called <i>Alma</i>. Most of these places
are small, but there is an <i>Elizabeth</i> with 75,000 population, an
<i>Elmira</i> with 40,000, and an <i>Augusta</i> with nearly 45,000.</p>

<p>The names of the second class we have already briefly observed.
They are betrayed in many cases by the prefix <i>New</i>;
more than 600 such postoffices are recorded, ranging from <i>New
Albany</i> to <i>New Windsor</i>. Others bear such prefixes as <i>West</i>,
<i>North</i> and <i>South</i>, or various distinguishing affixes, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Bostonia</i>,
<i>Pittsburgh Landing</i>, <i>Yorktown</i> and <i>Hartford City</i>. One
often finds eastern county names applied to western towns and
eastern town names applied to western rivers and mountains.
Thus, <i>Cambria</i>, which is the name of a county but not of a postoffice
in Pennsylvania, is a town name in seven western states;
<i>Baltimore</i> is the name of a glacier in Alaska, and <i>Princeton</i> is
the name of a peak in Colorado. In the same way the names of
the more easterly states often reappear in the west, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, in
<i>Mount Ohio</i>, Colo., <i>Delaware</i>, Okla., and <i>Virginia City</i>, Nev.
The tendency to name small American towns after the great capitals
of antiquity has excited the derision of the English since
the earliest days; there is scarcely an English book upon the states
without some fling at it. Of late it has fallen into abeyance,
though sixteen <i>Athenses</i> still remain, and there are yet many
<i>Carthages</i>, <i>Uticas</i>, <i>Syracuses</i>, <i>Romes</i>, <i>Alexandrias</i>, <i>Ninevahs</i> and
<i>Troys</i>. The third city of the nation, <i>Philadelphia</i>, got its name
from the ancient stronghold of Philadelphus of Pergamun. To
make up for the falling off of this old and flamboyant custom,
the more recent immigrants have brought with them the names
of the capitals and other great cities of their fatherlands. Thus
the American map bristles with <i>Berlins</i>, <i>Bremens</i>, <i>Hamburgs</i>,
<i>Warsaws</i> and <i>Leipzigs</i>, and is beginning to show <i>Stockholms</i>,
<i>Venices</i>, <i>Belgrades</i> and <i>Christianias</i>.</p>

<p>The influence of Indian names upon American nomenclature
is quickly shown by a glance at the map. No less than 26 of the
states have names borrowed from the aborigines, and the same
thing is true of most of our rivers and mountains. There was
an effort, at one time, to get rid of these Indian names. Thus <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg290"></a>[Pg290]</span>
the early Virginians changed the name of the <i>Powhatan</i> to the
<i>James</i>, and the first settlers in New York changed the name of
<i>Horicon</i> to <i>Lake George</i>. In the same way the present name of
the <i>White Mountains</i> displaced <i>Agiochook</i>, and <i>New Amsterdam</i>,
and later <i>New York</i>, displaced <i>Manhattan</i>, which has been recently
revived. The law of Hobson-Jobson made changes in
other Indian names, sometimes complete and sometimes only partial.
Thus, <i>Mauwauwaming</i> became <i>Wyoming</i>, <i>Maucwachoong</i>
became <i>Mauch Chunk</i>, <i>Ouabache</i> became <i>Wabash</i>, <i>Asingsing</i> became
<i>Sing-Sing</i>, and <i>Machihiganing</i> became <i>Michigan</i>. But
this vandalism did not go far enough to take away the brilliant
color of the aboriginal nomenclature. The second city of the
United States bears an Indian name, and so do the largest American
river, and the greatest American water-fall, and four of the
five great Lakes, and the scene of the most important military
decision ever reached on American soil.</p>

<p>The Dutch place-names of the United States are chiefly confined
to the vicinity of New York, and a good many of them
have become greatly corrupted. <i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>Wallabout</i> and
<i>Gramercy</i> offer examples. The first-named was originally
<i>Breuckelen</i>, the second was <i>Waale Bobht</i>, and the third was
<i>De Kromme Zee</i>. <i>Hell-Gate</i> is a crude translation of the Dutch
<i>Helle-Gat</i>. During the early part of the last century the more
delicate New Yorkers transformed the term into <i>Hurlgate</i>, but
the change was vigorously opposed by Washington Irving, and
so <i>Hell-Gate</i> was revived. The law of Hobson-Jobson early converted
the Dutch <i>hoek</i> into <i>hook</i>, and it survives in various place-names,
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Kinderhook</i> and <i>Sandy Hook</i>. The Dutch <i>kill</i> is a
<i>Grundwort</i> in many other names, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Catskill</i>, <i>Schuylkill</i>,
<i>Peekskill</i>, <i>Fishkill</i> and <i>Kill van Kull</i>; it is the equivalent of the
American <i>creek</i>. Many other Dutch place-names will come familiarly
to mind: <i>Harlem</i>, <i>Staten</i>, <i>Flushing</i>, <i>Cortlandt</i>, <i>Calver
Plaat</i>, <i>Nassau</i>, <i>Coenties</i>, <i>Spuyten Duyvel</i>, <i>Yonkers</i>, <i>Hoboken</i> and
<i>Bowery</i> (from <i>Bouvery</i>).<a name="FNanchor_40_460" id="FNanchor_40_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_460" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i>Block</i> Island was originally <i>Blok</i>,
and Cape <i>May</i>, according to Schele de Vere, was <i>Mey</i>, both Dutch. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg291"></a>[Pg291]</span>
A large number of New York street and neighborhood names
come down from Knickerbocker days, often greatly changed in
pronunciation. <i>Desbrosses</i> offers an example. The Dutch called
it <i>de Broose</i>, but in New York today it is commonly spoken of as
<i>Dez-bros-sez</i>.</p>

<p>French place-names have suffered almost as severely. Few
persons would recognize <i>Smackover</i>, the name of a small town
in Arkansas, as French, and yet in its original form it was
<i>Chemin Couvert</i>. Schele de Vere, in 1871, recorded the degeneration
of the name to <i>Smack Cover</i>; the Postoffice, always
eager to shorten and simplify names, has since made one word
of it and got rid of the redundant <i>c</i>. In the same way <i>Bob Ruly</i>,
a Missouri name, descends from <i>Bois Brulé</i>. "The American
tongue," says W. W. Crane, "seems to lend itself reluctantly
to the words of alien languages."<a name="FNanchor_41_461" id="FNanchor_41_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_461" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This is shown plainly by
the history of French place-names among us. A large number
of them, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Lac Superieur</i>, were translated into English at
an early day, and most of those that remain are now pronounced
as if they were English. Thus <i>Des Moines</i> is <i>dee-moyns</i>, <i>Terre
Haute</i> is <i>terry-hut</i>, <i>Beaufort</i> is <i>byu-fort</i>, <i>New Orleans</i> is <i>or-leens</i>,
<i>Lafayette</i> has a flat <i>a</i>, <i>Havre de Grace</i> has another, and <i>Versailles</i>
is <i>ver-sales</i>. The pronunciation of <i>sault</i>, as in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i>,
is commonly more or less correct; the Minneapolis, St. Paul and
Sault Ste. Marie Railroad is popularly called the <i>Soo</i>. This
may be due to Canadian example, or to some confusion between
<i>Sault</i> and <i>Sioux</i>. The French <i>Louis</i>, in <i>St. Louis</i> and <i>Louisville</i>,
is usually pronounced correctly. So is the <i>rouge</i> in <i>Baton
Rouge</i>, though the <i>baton</i> is commonly boggled. It is possible
that familiarity with <i>St. Louis</i> influenced the local pronunciation
of <i>Illinois</i>, which is <i>Illinoy</i>, but this may be a mere attempt
to improve upon the vulgar <i>Illin-i</i>.<a name="FNanchor_42_462" id="FNanchor_42_462"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42_462" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>For a number of years the Geographic Board has been seeking <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg292"></a>[Pg292]</span>
vainly to reestablish the correct pronunciation of the name
of the <i>Purgatoire</i> river in Colorado. Originally named the <i>Rio
de las Animas</i> by the Spaniards, it was renamed the <i>Rivière du
Purgatoire</i> by their French successors. The American pioneers
changed this to <i>Picketwire</i>, and that remains the local name of
the stream to this day, despite the effort of the Geographic Board
to compromise on <i>Purgatoire</i> river. Many other French names
are being anglicized with its aid and consent. Already half a
dozen <i>Bellevues</i> have been changed to <i>Belleviews</i> and <i>Bellviews</i>,
and the spelling of nearly all the <i>Belvédères</i> has been changed to
<i>Belvidere</i>. <i>Belair</i>, La., represents the end-product of a process
of decay which began with <i>Belle Aire</i>, and then proceeded to
<i>Bellaire</i> and <i>Bellair</i>. All these forms are still to be found, together
with <i>Bel Air</i>. The Geographic Board's antipathy to
accented letters and to names of more than one word<a name="FNanchor_43_463" id="FNanchor_43_463"></a><a
href="#Footnote_43_463" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> has converted
<i>Isle Ste. Thérèse</i>, in the St. Lawrence river, to <i>Isle Ste.
Therese</i>, a truly abominable barbarism, and <i>La Cygne</i>, in Kansas,
to <i>Lacygne</i>, which is even worse. <i>Lamoine</i>, <i>Labelle</i>, <i>Lagrange</i>
and <i>Lamonte</i> are among its other improvements; <i>Lafayette</i>, for
<i>La Fayette</i>, long antedates the beginning of its labors.</p>

<p>The Spanish names of the Southwest are undergoing a like
process of corruption, though without official aid. <i>San Antonio</i>
has been changed to <i>San Antone</i> in popular pronunciation and
seems likely to go to <i>San Tone</i>; <i>El Paso</i> has acquired a flat
American <i>a</i> and a <i>z</i>-sound in place of the Spanish <i>s</i>; <i>Los Angeles</i>
presents such difficulties that no two of its inhabitants agree
upon the proper pronunciation, and many compromise on simple
<i>Los</i>, as the folks of <i>Jacksonville</i> commonly call their town <i>Jax</i>.
Some of the most mellifluous of American place-names are in
the areas once held by the Spaniards. It would be hard to match
the beauty of <i>Santa Margarita</i>, <i>San Anselmo</i>, <i>Alamogordo</i>, <i>Terra
Amarilla</i>, <i>Sabinoso</i>, <i>Las Palomas</i>, <i>Ensenada</i>, <i>Nogales</i>, <i>San Patricio</i>
and <i>Bernalillo</i>. But they are under a severe and double
assault. Not only do the present lords of the soil debase them
in speaking them; in many cases they are formally displaced
by native names of the utmost harshness and banality. Thus, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg293"></a>[Pg293]</span>
one finds in New Mexico such absurdly-named towns as <i>Sugarite</i>,
<i>Shoemaker</i>, <i>Newhope</i>, <i>Lordsburg</i>, <i>Eastview</i> and <i>Central</i>; in
Arizona such places as <i>Old Glory</i>, <i>Springerville</i>, <i>Wickenburg</i>
and <i>Congress Junction</i>, and even in California such abominations
as <i>Oakhurst</i>, <i>Ben Hur</i>, <i>Drytown</i>, <i>Skidoo</i>, <i>Susanville</i>, <i>Uno</i>
and <i>Ono</i>.</p>

<p>The early Spaniards were prodigal with place-names testifying
to their piety, but these names, in the overwhelming main,
were those of saints. Add <i>Salvador</i>, <i>Trinidad</i> and <i>Concepcion</i>,
and their repertoire is almost exhausted. If they ever named
a town <i>Jesus</i> the name has been obliterated by Anglo-Saxon
prudery; even their use of the name as a personal appellation
violates American notions of the fitting. The names of the Jewish
patriarchs and those of the holy places in Palestine do not
appear among their place-names; their Christianity seems to
have been exclusively of the New Testament. But the Americans
who displaced them were intimately familiar with both books
of the Bible, and one finds copious proofs of it on the map of
the United States. There are no less than seven <i>Bethlehems</i>
in the Postal Guide, and the name is also applied to various
mountains, and to one of the reaches of the Ohio river. I find
thirteen <i>Bethanys</i>, seventeen <i>Bethels</i>, eleven <i>Beulahs</i>, nine <i>Canaans</i>,
eleven <i>Jordans</i> and twenty-one <i>Sharons</i>. <i>Adam</i> is sponsor
for a town in West Virginia and an island in the Chesapeake, and
<i>Eve</i> for a village in Kentucky. There are five postoffices named
<i>Aaron</i>, two named <i>Abraham</i>, two named <i>Job</i>, and a town and a
lake named <i>Moses</i>. Most of the <i>St. Pauls</i> and <i>St. Josephs</i> of
the country were inherited from the French, but the two <i>St.
Patricks</i> show a later influence. Eight <i>Wesleys</i> and <i>Wesleyvilles</i>,
eight <i>Asburys</i> and twelve names embodying <i>Luther</i> indicate
the general theological trend of the plain people. There
is a village in Maryland, too small to have a postoffice, named
<i>Gott</i>, and I find <i>Gotts Island</i> in Maine and <i>Gottville</i> in California,
but no doubt these were named after German settlers
of that awful name, and not after the Lord God directly. There
are four <i>Trinities</i>, to say nothing of the inherited Spanish <i>Trinidads</i>. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg294"></a>[Pg294]</span></p>

<p>Names wholly or partly descriptive of localities are very
numerous throughout the country, and among the <i>Grundwörter</i>
embodied in them are terms highly characteristic of America
and almost unknown to the English vocabulary. <i>Bald Knob</i>
would puzzle an Englishman, but the name is so common in the
United States that the Geographic Board has had to take measures
against it. Others of that sort are <i>Council Bluffs</i>, <i>Patapsco
Neck</i>, <i>Delaware Water Gap</i>, <i>Curtis Creek</i>, <i>Walden Pond</i>, <i>Sandy
Hook</i>, <i>Key West</i>, <i>Bull Run</i>, <i>Portage</i>, <i>French Lick</i>, <i>Jones Gulch</i>,
<i>Watkins Gully</i>, <i>Cedar Bayou</i>, <i>Keams Canyon</i>, <i>Parker Notch</i>,
<i>Sucker Branch</i>, <i>Fraziers Bottom</i> and <i>Eagle Pass</i>. <i>Butte Creek</i>,
in <i>Montana</i>, is a name made up of two Americanisms. There
are thirty-five postoffices whose names embody the word <i>prairie</i>,
several of them, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Prairie du Chien</i>, Wis., inherited from
the French. There are seven <i>Divides</i>, eight <i>Buttes</i>, eight town-names
embodying the word <i>burnt</i>, innumerable names embodying
<i>grove</i>, <i>barren</i>, <i>plain</i>, <i>fork</i>, <i>center</i>, <i>cross-roads</i>, <i>courthouse</i>,
<i>cove</i> and <i>ferry</i>, and a great swarm of <i>Cold Springs</i>, <i>Coldwaters</i>,
<i>Summits</i>, <i>Middletowns</i> and <i>Highlands</i>. The flora and fauna of
the land are enormously represented. There are twenty-two
<i>Buffalos</i> beside the city in New York, and scores of <i>Buffalo
Creeks</i>, <i>Ridges</i>, <i>Springs</i> and <i>Wallows</i>. The <i>Elks</i>, in various
forms, are still more numerous, and there are dozens of towns,
mountains, lakes, creeks and country districts named after the
<i>beaver</i>, <i>martin</i>, <i>coyote</i>, <i>moose</i> and <i>otter</i>, and as many more named
after such characteristic flora as the <i>paw-paw</i>, the <i>sycamore</i>, the
<i>cottonwood</i>, the <i>locust</i> and the <i>sunflower</i>. There is an <i>Alligator</i>
in Mississippi, a <i>Crawfish</i> in Kentucky and a <i>Rat Lake</i> on the
Canadian border of Minnesota. The endless search for mineral
wealth has besprinkled the map with such names as <i>Bromide</i>,
<i>Oil City</i>, <i>Anthracite</i>, <i>Chrome</i>, <i>Chloride</i>, <i>Coal Run</i>, <i>Goldfield</i>,
<i>Telluride</i>, <i>Leadville</i> and <i>Cement</i>.</p>

<p>There was a time, particularly during the gold rush to California,
when the rough humor of the country showed itself in
the invention of extravagant and often highly felicitous place-names,
but with the growth of population and the rise of civic
spirit they have tended to be replaced with more seemly coinages. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg295"></a>[Pg295]</span>
<i>Catfish</i> creek, in Wisconsin, is now the <i>Yahara</i> river; the
<i>Bulldog</i> mountains, in Arizona, have become the <i>Harosomas</i>;
the <i>Picketwire</i> river, as we have seen, has resumed its old French
name of <i>Purgatoire</i>. As with natural features of the landscape,
so with towns. Nearly all the old <i>Boozevilles</i>, <i>Jackass Flats</i>,
<i>Three Fingers</i>, <i>Hell-For-Sartains</i>, <i>Undershirt Hills</i>, <i>Razzle-Dazzles</i>,
<i>Cow-Tails</i>, <i>Yellow Dogs</i>, <i>Jim-Jamses</i>, <i>Jump-Offs</i>, <i>Poker
Citys</i> and <i>Skunktowns</i> have yielded to the growth of delicacy,
but <i>Tombstone</i> still stands in Arizona, <i>Goose Bill</i> remains a
postoffice in Montana, and the Geographic Board gives its imprimatur
to the <i>Horsethief</i> trail in Colorado, to <i>Burning Bear</i>
creek in the same state, and to <i>Pig Eye</i> lake in Minnesota. Various
other survivors of a more lively and innocent day linger on
the map: <i>Blue Ball</i>, Ark., <i>Cowhide</i>, W. Va., <i>Dollarville</i>, Mich.,
<i>Oven Fork</i>, Ky., <i>Social Circle</i>, Ga., <i>Sleepy Eye</i>, Minn., <i>Bubble</i>,
Ark., <i>Shy Beaver</i>, Pa., <i>Shin Pond</i>, Me., <i>Rough-and-Ready</i>, Calif.,
<i>Non Intervention</i>, Va., <i>Noodle</i>, Tex., <i>Nursery</i>, Mo., <i>Number Four</i>,
N. Y., <i>Oblong</i>, Ill., <i>Stock Yards</i>, Neb., <i>Stout</i>, Iowa, and so on.
West Virginia, the wildest of the eastern states, is full of such
place-names. Among them I find <i>Affinity</i>, <i>Annamoriah</i> (<i>Anna
Maria?</i>), <i>Bee</i>, <i>Bias</i>, <i>Big Chimney</i>, <i>Billie</i>, <i>Blue Jay</i>, <i>Bulltown</i>,
<i>Caress</i>, <i>Cinderella</i>, <i>Cyclone</i>, <i>Czar</i>, <i>Cornstalk</i>, <i>Duck</i>, <i>Halcyon</i>,
<i>Jingo</i>, <i>Left Hand</i>, <i>Ravens Eye</i>, <i>Six</i>, <i>Skull Run</i>, <i>Three Churches</i>,
<i>Uneeda</i>, <i>Wide Mouth</i>, <i>War Eagle</i> and <i>Stumptown</i>. The Postal
Guide shows two <i>Ben Hurs</i>, five <i>St. Elmos</i> and ten <i>Ivanhoes</i>,
but only one <i>Middlemarch</i>. There are seventeen <i>Roosevelts</i>, six
<i>Codys</i> and six <i>Barnums</i>, but no <i>Shakespeare</i>. <i>Washington</i>, of
course, is the most popular of American place-names. But
among names of postoffices it is hard pushed by <i>Clinton</i>, <i>Centerville</i>,
<i>Liberty</i>, <i>Canton</i>, <i>Marion</i> and <i>Madison</i>, and even by <i>Springfield</i>,
<i>Warren</i> and <i>Bismarck</i>.</p>

<p>The Geographic Board, in its laudable effort to simplify American
nomenclature, has played ducks and drakes with some of
the most picturesque names on the national map. Now and
then, as in the case of <i>Purgatoire</i>, it has temporarily departed
from this policy, but in the main its influence has been thrown
against the fine old French and Spanish names, and against the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg296"></a>[Pg296]</span>
more piquant native names no less. Thus, I find it deciding
against <i>Portage des Flacons</i> and in favor of the hideous <i>Bottle
portage</i>, against <i>Cañada del Burro</i> and in favor of <i>Burro canyon</i>
against <i>Canos y Ylas de la Cruz</i> and in favor of the barbarous
<i>Cruz island</i>. In <i>Bougére landing</i> and <i>Cañon City</i> it has deleted
the accents. The name of the <i>De Grasse river</i> it has changed to
<i>Grass</i>. <i>De Laux</i> it has changed to the intolerable <i>Dlo</i>. And,
as we have seen, it has steadily amalgamated French and Spanish
articles with their nouns, thus achieving such forms as
<i>Duchesne</i>, <i>Eldorado</i>, <i>Deleon</i> and <i>Laharpe</i>. But here its policy
is fortunately inconsistent, and so a number of fine old names
has escaped. Thus, it has decided in favor of <i>Bon Secours</i> and
against <i>Bonsecours</i>, and in favor of <i>De Soto</i>, <i>La Crosse</i> and <i>La
Moure</i>, and against <i>Desoto</i>, <i>Lacrosse</i> and <i>Lamoure</i>. Here its
decisions are confused and often unintelligible. Why <i>Laporte</i>,
Pa., and <i>La Porte</i>, Iowa? Why <i>Lagrange</i>, Ind., and <i>La Grange</i>,
Ky.? Here it would seem to be yielding a great deal too much
to local usage.</p>

<p>The Board proceeds to the shortening and simplification of
native names by various devices. It deletes such suffixes as
<i>town</i>, <i>city</i> and <i>courthouse</i>; it removes the apostrophe and often
the genitive <i>s</i> from such names as <i>St. Mary's</i>; it shortens <i>burgh</i>
to <i>burg</i> and <i>borough</i> to <i>boro</i>; and it combines separate and often
highly discreet words. The last habit often produces grotesque
forms, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Newberlin</i>, <i>Boxelder</i>, <i>Sabbathday lake</i>, <i>Fallentimber</i>,
<i>Bluemountain</i>, <i>Westtown</i>, <i>Threepines</i> and <i>Missionhill</i>. It apparently
cherishes a hope of eventually regularizing the spelling
of <i>Allegany</i>. This is now <i>Allegany</i> for the Maryland county,
the Pennsylvania township and the New York and Oregon towns,
<i>Alleghany</i> for the mountains, the Colorado town and the Virginia
town and springs, and <i>Allegheny</i> for the Pittsburgh borough
and the Pennsylvania county, college and river. The
Board inclines to <i>Allegheny</i> for both river and mountains.
Other Indian names give it constant concern. Its struggles to
set up <i>Chemquasabamticook</i> as the name of a Maine lake in
place of <i>Chemquasabamtic</i> and <i>Chemquassabamticook</i>, and <i>Chatahospee</i>
as the name of an Alabama creek in place of <i>Chattahospee</i>, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg297"></a>[Pg297]</span>
<i>Hoolethlocco</i>, <i>Hoolethloces</i>, <i>Hoolethloco</i> and <i>Hootethlocco</i>
are worthy of its learning and authority.<a name="FNanchor_44_464" id="FNanchor_44_464"></a><a
href="#Footnote_44_464" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The American tendency to pronounce all the syllables of a
word more distinctly than the English shows itself in geographical
names. White, in 1880,<a name="FNanchor_45_465" id="FNanchor_45_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_465" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> recorded the increasing habit of
giving full value to the syllables of such borrowed English names
as <i>Worcester</i> and <i>Warwick</i>. I have frequently noted the same
thing. In Worcester county, Maryland, the name is usually
pronounced <i>Wooster</i>, but on the Western Shore of the state one
hears <i>Worcest-'r</i>.<a name="FNanchor_46_466" id="FNanchor_46_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_466" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> <i>Norwich</i> is another such name; one hears
<i>Nor-wich</i> quite as often as <i>Norrich</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_467" id="FNanchor_47_467"></a><a
href="#Footnote_47_467" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Yet another is <i>Delhi</i>; one
often hears <i>Del-high</i>. White said that in his youth the name
of the <i>Shawangunk</i> mountains, in New York, was pronounced
<i>Shongo</i>, but that the custom of pronouncing it as spelled had
arisen during his manhood. So with <i>Winnipiseogee</i>, the name
of a lake; once <i>Winipisaukie</i>, it gradually came to be pronounced
as spelled. There is frequently a considerable difference between
the pronunciation of a name by natives of a place and its
pronunciation by those who are familiar with it only in print.
<i>Baltimore</i> offers an example. The natives always drop the
medial <i>i</i> and so reduce the name to two syllables; the habit identifies
them. <i>Anne Arundel</i>, the name of a county in Maryland, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg298"></a>[Pg298]</span>
is usually pronounced <i>Ann 'ran'l</i> by its people. <i>Arkansas</i>, as
everyone knows, is pronounced <i>Arkansaw</i> by the Arkansans,
and the Nevadans give the name of their state a flat <i>a</i>. The
local pronunciation of <i>Illinois</i> I have already noticed. <i>Iowa</i>,
at home, is often <i>Ioway</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_468" id="FNanchor_48_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_468" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Many American geographical names
offer great difficulty to Englishmen. One of my English acquaintances
tells me that he was taught at school to accent
<i>Massachusetts</i> on the second syllable, to rhyme the second syllable
of <i>Ohio</i> with <i>tea</i>, and to sound the first <i>c</i> in <i>Connecticut</i>. In
Maryland the name of <i>Calvert</i> county is given a broad <i>a</i>, whereas
the name of <i>Calvert</i> street, in Baltimore, has a flat <i>a</i>. This
curious distinction is almost always kept up. A Scotchman,
coming to America, would give the <i>ch</i> in such names as <i>Loch
Raven</i> and <i>Lochvale</i> the guttural Scotch (and German) sound,
but locally it is always pronounced as if it were <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a curious difference between English and
American usage in the use of the word <i>river</i>. The English invariably
put it before the proper name, whereas we almost as
invariably put it after. <i>The Thames river</i> would seem quite
as strange to an Englishman as <i>the river Chicago</i> would seem
to us. This difference arose more than a century ago and was
noticed by Pickering. But in his day the American usage was
still somewhat uncertain, and such forms as <i>the river Mississippi</i>
were yet in use. Today <i>river</i> almost always goes after the proper
name.</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="Street_Names"></a>Street Names</h3>—"Such a locality as 'the <i>corner</i> of <i>Avenue H</i>
and <i>Twenty-third</i> street,'" says W. W. Crane, "is about as
distinctively American as Algonquin and Iroquois names like
<i>Mississippi</i> and <i>Saratoga</i>."<a name="FNanchor_49_469" id="FNanchor_49_469"></a><a
href="#Footnote_49_469" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Kipling, in his "American
Notes,"<a name="FNanchor_50_470" id="FNanchor_50_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_470"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> gives testimony to the strangeness with which the <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg299"></a>[Pg299]</span>
number-names, the phrase "the corner of," and the custom of
omitting <i>street</i> fall upon the ear of a Britisher. He quotes with
amazement certain directions given to him on his arrival in San
Francisco from India: "Go six blocks north to [the] corner
of <i>Geary</i> and <i>Markey</i> [<i>Market?</i>]; then walk around till you
strike [the] corner of <i>Gutter</i> and <i>Sixteenth</i>." The English always
add the word <i>street</i> (or <i>road</i> or <i>place</i> or <i>avenue</i>) when
speaking of a thoroughfare; such a phrase as "<i>Oxford</i> and <i>New
Bond</i>" would strike them as incongruous. The American custom
of numbering and lettering streets is almost always ascribed
by English writers who discuss it, not to a desire to make finding
them easy, but to sheer poverty of invention. The English apparently
have an inexhaustible fund of names for streets; they
often give one street more than one name. Thus, <i>Oxford</i> street,
London, becomes the <i>Bayswater</i> road, <i>High</i> street, <i>Holland Park</i>
avenue, <i>Goldhawke</i> road and finally the <i>Oxford</i> road to the
westward, and <i>High Holborn</i>, <i>Holborn</i> viaduct, <i>Newgate</i> street,
<i>Cheapside</i>, the <i>Poultry</i>, <i>Cornhill</i> and <i>Leadenhall</i> street to the
eastward. The Strand, in the same way, becomes <i>Fleet</i> street,
<i>Ludgate</i> hill and <i>Cannon</i> street. Nevertheless, there is a <i>First</i>
avenue in <i>Queen's Park</i>, and parallel to it are <i>Second</i>, <i>Third</i>,
<i>Fourth</i>, <i>Fifth</i> and <i>Sixth</i> avenues—all small streets leading
northward from the Harrow road, just east of Kensal Green
cemetery. I have observed that few Londoners have ever heard
of them. There is also a <i>First</i> street in Chelsea—a very modest
thoroughfare near Lennox gardens and not far from the Brompton
Oratory.</div>

<p>Next to the numbering and lettering of streets, a fashion apparently
set up by Major Pierre-Charles L'Enfant's plans for
Washington, the most noticeable feature of American street
nomenclature, as opposed to that of England, is the extensive
use of such designations as <i>avenue</i>, <i>boulevard</i>, <i>drive</i> and <i>speedway</i>.
<i>Avenue</i> is used in England, but only rather sparingly; it
is seldom applied to a mean street, or to one in a warehouse district.
In America the word is scarcely distinguished in meaning
from <i>street</i>.<a name="FNanchor_51_471" id="FNanchor_51_471"></a><a
href="#Footnote_51_471" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
<i>Boulevard</i>, <i>drive</i> and <i>speedway</i> are almost <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg300"></a>[Pg300]</span>
unknown to the English, but they use <i>road</i> for urban thoroughfares,
which is very seldom done in America, and they also make
free use of <i>place</i>, <i>walk</i>, <i>passage</i>, <i>lane</i> and <i>circus</i>, all of which are
obsolescent on this side of the ocean. Some of the older American
cities, such as Boston and Baltimore, have surviving certain
ancient English designations of streets, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>Cheapside</i> and <i>Cornhill</i>;
these are unknown in the newer American towns. <i>Broadway</i>,
which is also English, is more common. Many American
towns now have <i>plazas</i>, which are unknown in England. Nearly
all have <i>City Hall parks</i>, <i>squares</i> or <i>places</i>; <i>City Hall</i> is also
unknown over there. The principal street of a small town, in
America, is almost always <i>Main street</i>; in England it is as invariably
<i>High</i> street, usually with the definite article before
<i>High</i>.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the corruption of old Dutch street and
neighborhood names in New York. Spanish names are corrupted
in the same way in the Southwest and French names in the Great
Lakes region and in Louisiana. In New Orleans the street names,
many of them strikingly beautiful, are pronounced so barbarously
by the people that a Frenchman would have difficulty
recognizing them. Thus, <i>Bourbon</i> has become <i>Bur-bun</i>, <i>Dauphine</i>
is <i>Daw-fin</i>, <i>Foucher</i> is <i>Foosh'r</i>, <i>Enghien</i> is <i>En-gine</i>, and
<i>Felicity</i> (originally <i>Félicité</i>) is <i>Fill-a-city</i>. The French, in their
days, bestowed the names of the Muses upon certain of the city
streets. They are now pronounced <i>Cal´-y-ope</i>, <i>Terp´-si-chore</i>,
<i>Mel-po-mean´</i>, <i>You-terp´</i>, and so on. <i>Bon Enfants</i>, apparently
too difficult for the native, has been translated into <i>Good Children</i>.
Only <i>Esplanade</i> and <i>Bagatelle</i>, among the French street
names of the city, seem to be commonly pronounced with any
approach to correctness.</p>

female line to adopt the family name on inheriting the family property.
Formerly the heir dropped his own surname. Thus the ancestor of the
present Duke of Northumberland, born <i>Smithson</i>, took the ancient name of
<i>Percy</i> on succeeding to the underlying earldom in the eighteenth century.
But about a hundred years ago, heirs in like case began to join the two
names by hyphenation, and such names are now very common in the British
peerage. Thus the surname of Lord Barrymore is <i>Smith-Barry</i>, that of
Lord Vernon is <i>Venables-Vernon</i>, and that of the Earl of Wharncliffe is
<i>Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie</i>.</p></div>

Proverb and Platitude</h3>
—No people, save perhaps the Spaniards,
have a richer store of proverbial wisdom than the Americans,
and surely none other make more diligent and deliberate efforts
to augment its riches. The American literature of "inspirational"
platitude is enormous and almost unique. There are
half a dozen authors, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, Dr. Orison Swett Marden and Dr.
Frank Crane, who devote themselves exclusively, and to vast
profit, to the composition of arresting and uplifting apothegms,
and the fruits of their fancy are not only sold in books but also
displayed upon an infinite variety of calendars, banners and
wall-cards. It is rarely that one enters the office of an American
business man without encountering at least one of these wall-cards.
It may, on the one hand, show nothing save a succinct
caution that time is money, say, "Do It Now," or "This Is My
Busy Day"; on the other hand, it may embody a long and complex
sentiment, ornately set forth. The taste for such canned
sagacity seems to have arisen in America at a very early day.
Benjamin Franklin's "Poor Richard's Almanac," begun in 1732,
remained a great success for twenty-five years, and the annual
sales reached 10,000. It had many imitators, and founded an
aphoristic style of writing which culminated in the essays of
Emerson, often mere strings of sonorous certainties, defectively
articulated. The "Proverbial Philosophy" of Martin Farquhar
Tupper, dawning upon the American public in the early 40's,
was welcomed with enthusiasm; as Saintsbury says,<a name="FNanchor_1_472" id="FNanchor_1_472"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1_472" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> its success <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg302"></a>[Pg302]</span>
on this side of the Atlantic even exceeded its success on the other.
But that was the last and perhaps the only importation of the
sage and mellifluous in bulk. In late years the American production
of such merchandise has grown so large that the balance
of trade now flows in the other direction. Visiting Denmark,
Germany, Switzerland, France and Spain in the spring of 1917,
I found translations of the chief works of Dr. Marden on sale in
all those countries, and with them the masterpieces of such other
apostles of the New Thought as Ralph Waldo Trine and Elizabeth
Towne. No other American books were half so well displayed.</div>

<p>The note of all such literature, and of the maxims that precipitate
themselves from it, is optimism. They "inspire" by voicing
and revoicing the New Thought doctrine that all things are possible
to the man who thinks the right sort of thoughts—in the
national phrase, to the <i>right-thinker</i>. This right-thinker is indistinguishable
from the <i>forward-looker</i>, whose belief in the continuity
and benignity of the evolutionary process takes on the
virulence of a religious faith. Out of his confidence come the
innumerable saws, axioms and <i class="abblatin">geflügelte Worte</i> in the national
arsenal, ranging from the "It won't hurt none to try" of the
great masses of the plain people to such exhilarating confections
of the wall-card virtuosi as "The elevator to success is not running;
take the stairs." Naturally enough, a grotesque humor
plays about this literature of hope; the folk, though it moves
them, prefer it with a dash of salt. "Smile, damn you, smile!"
is a typical specimen of this seasoned optimism. Many examples
of it go back to the early part of the last century, for instance,
"Don't monkey with the buzz-saw" and "It will never
get well if you pick it." Others are patently modern, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>,
"The Lord is my shepherd; I should worry" and "Roll over;
you're on your back." The national talent for extravagant and
pungent humor is well displayed in many of these maxims. It
would be difficult to match, in any other folk-literature, such
examples as "I'd rather have them say 'There he goes' than
'Here he lies,'" or "Don't spit: remember the Johnstown
flood," or "Shoot it in the arm; your leg's full," or "Cheer up; <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg303"></a>[Pg303]</span>
there ain't no hell," or "If you want to cure homesickness, go
back home." Many very popular phrases and proverbs are
borrowings from above. "Few die and none resign" originated
with Thomas Jefferson; Bret Harte, I believe, was the author
of "No check-ee, no shirt-ee," General W. T. Sherman is commonly
credited with "War is hell," and Mark Twain with "Life
is one damn thing after another." An elaborate and highly
characteristic proverb of the uplifting variety—"So live that
you can look any man in the eye and tell him to go to hell"—was
first given currency by one of the engineers of the Panama
Canal, a gentleman later retired, it would seem, for attempting
to execute his own counsel. From humor the transition to
cynicism is easy, and so many of the current sayings are at
war with the optimism of the majority. "Kick him again; he's
down" is a depressing example. "What's the use?" a rough
translation of the Latin "Cui bono?" is another. The same
spirit is visible in "Tell your troubles to a policeman," "How'd
you like to be the ice-man?" "Some say she do and some say
she don't," "Nobody loves a fat man," "I love my wife, but
O you kid," and "Would you for fifty cents?" The last originated
in the ingenious mind of an advertisement writer and
was immediately adopted. In the course of time it acquired a
naughty significance, and helped to give a start to the amazing
button craze of ten or twelve years ago—a saturnalia of proverb
and phrase making which finally aroused the guardians of the
public morals and was put down by the police.</p>

<p>That neglect which marks the study of the vulgate generally
extends to the subject of popular proverb-making. The English
publisher, Frank Palmer, prints an excellent series of little volumes
presenting the favorite proverbs of all civilized races, including
the Chinese and Japanese, but there is no American
volume among them. Even such exhaustive collections as that
of Robert Christy<a name="FNanchor_2_473" id="FNanchor_2_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_473" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> contain no American specimens—not even
"Don't monkey with the buzz-saw" or "Root, hog, or die." <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg304"></a>[Pg304]</span></p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 2</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="American_Slang"></a>American Slang</h3>—This neglect of the national proverbial
philosophy extends to the national slang. There is but one
work, so far as I can discover, formally devoted to it,<a name="FNanchor_3_474" id="FNanchor_3_474"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3_474" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and that
work is extremely superficial. Moreover, it has been long out
of date, and hence is of little save historical value. There are
at least a dozen careful treatises on French slang,<a name="FNanchor_4_475" id="FNanchor_4_475"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_475" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> half as many
on English slang,<a name="FNanchor_5_476" id="FNanchor_5_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_476" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and a good many on German slang, but American
slang, which is probably quite as rich as that of France
and a good deal richer than that of any other country, is yet
to be studied at length. Nor is there much discussion of it, of
any interest or value, in the general philological literature.
Fowler and all the other early native students of the language
dismissed it with lofty gestures; down to the time of Whitney
it was scarcely regarded as a seemly subject for the notice of a
man of learning. Lounsbury, less pedantic, viewed its phenomena
more hospitably, and even defined it as "the source from which
the decaying energies of speech are constantly refreshed," and
Brander Matthews, following him, has described its function as
that of providing "substitutes for the good words and true which
are worn out by hard service."<a name="FNanchor_6_477" id="FNanchor_6_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_477" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But that is about as far as
the investigation has got. Krapp has some judicious paragraphs
upon the matter in his "Modern English,"<a name="FNanchor_7_478" id="FNanchor_7_478"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_478" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> there are a few
scattered essays upon the underlying psychology,<a name="FNanchor_8_479" id="FNanchor_8_479"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_479" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and various
uninforming magazine articles, but that is all. The practising
authors of the country, like its philologians, have always shown <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg305"></a>[Pg305]</span>
a gingery and suspicious attitude. "The use of slang," said
Oliver Wendell Holmes, "is at once a sign and a cause of mental
atrophy." "Slang," said Ambrose Bierce fifty years later,
"is the speech of him who robs the literary garbage carts on
their way to the dumps." Literature in America, as we have
seen, remains aloof from the vulgate. Despite the contrary
examples of Mark Twain and Howells, all the more pretentious
American authors try to write chastely and elegantly; the typical
literary product of the country is still a refined essay in the
<cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, perhaps gently jocose but never rough—by
Emerson, so to speak, out of Charles Lamb—the sort of thing
one might look to be done by a somewhat advanced English curate.
George Ade, undoubtedly one of the most adept anatomists of
the American character and painters of the American scene
that the national literature has yet developed, is neglected because
his work is grounded firmly upon the national speech—not
that he reports it literally, like Lardner and the hacks trailing
after Lardner, but that he gets at and exhibits its very
essence. It would stagger a candidate for a doctorate in philology,
I daresay, to be told off by his professor to investigate
the slang of Ade in the way that Bosson,<a name="FNanchor_9_480" id="FNanchor_9_480"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9_480" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the Swede, has investigated
that of Jerome K. Jerome, and yet, until something
of the sort is undertaken, American philology will remain out
of contact with the American language.</div>

<p>Most of the existing discussions of slang spend themselves
upon efforts to define it, and, in particular, upon efforts to
differentiate it from idiomatic neologisms of a more legitimate
type. This effort is largely in vain; the border-line is too vague
and wavering to be accurately mapped; words and phrases are
constantly crossing it, and in both directions. There was a
time, perhaps, when the familiar American counter-word, <i>proposition</i>,
was slang; its use seems to have originated in the world
of business, and it was soon afterward adopted by the sporting
fraternity. But today it is employed without much feeling that
it needs apology, and surely without any feeling that it is low. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg306"></a>[Pg306]</span>
<i>Nice</i>, as an adjective of all work, was once in slang use only;
today no one would question "a <i>nice</i> day," or "a <i>nice</i> time" or
"a <i>nice</i> hotel." <i>Awful</i> seems to be going the same route. "<i>Awful</i>
sweet" and "<i>awfully</i> dear" still seem slangy and school-girlish,
but "<i>awful</i> children," "<i>awful</i> weather" and "an <i>awful</i>
job" have entirely sound support, and no one save a pedant
would hesitate to use them. Such insidious purifications and
consecrations of slang are going on under our noses all the
time. The use of <i>some</i> as a general adjective-adverb seems
likely to make its way in the same manner. It is constantly forgotten
by purists of defective philological equipment that a
great many of our most respectable words and phrases originated
in the plainest sort of slang. Thus, <i>quandary</i>, despite a
fanciful etymology which would identify it with <i>wandreth</i>
(=<i>evil</i>), is probably simply a composition form of the French
phrase, <i>qu'en dirai-je?</i> Again, to turn to French itself, there
is <i>tête</i>, a sound name for the human head for many centuries—though
its origin was in the Latin <i>testa</i> (=<i>pot</i>), a favorite slang-word
of the soldiers of the decaying empire, analogous to our
own <i>block</i>, <i>nut</i> and <i>conch</i>. The word <i>slacker</i>, recently come into
good usage in the United States as a designation for an unsuccessful
shirker of conscription, is a substantive derived from
the English verb <i>to slack</i>, which was born as university slang and
remains so to this day. Brander Matthews, so recently as 1901,
thought <i>to hold up</i> slang; it is now perfectly good American.</p>

<p>The contrary movement of words from the legitimate vocabulary
into slang is constantly witnessed. Some one devises a new
and intriguing trope or makes use of an old one under circumstances
arresting the public attention, and at once it is
adopted into slang, given a host of remote significances, and
ding-donged <i class="abblatin">ad nauseam</i>. The Rooseveltian phrases, <i>muck-raker</i>,
<i>Ananias Club</i>, <i>short and ugly word</i>, <i>nature-faker</i> and <i>big-stick</i>,
offer examples. Not one of them was new and not one of
them was of much pungency, but Roosevelt's vast talent for
delighting the yokelry threw about them a charming air, and
so they entered into current slang and were mouthed idiotically
for months. Another example is to be found in <i>steam-roller</i>. <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg307"></a>[Pg307]</span>
It was first heard of in June, 1908, when it was applied by Oswald
F. Schuette, of the <cite>Chicago Inter-Ocean</cite>, to the methods
employed by the Roosevelt-Taft majority in the Republican
National Committee in over-riding the protests against seating
Taft delegates from Alabama and Arkansas. At once it struck
the popular fancy and was soon heard on all sides. All the
usual derivatives appeared, <i>to steam-roller</i>, <i>steam-rollered</i>, and
so on. Since then, curiously enough, the term has gradually
forced its way back from slang to good usage, and even gone over
to England. In the early days of the Great War it actually
appeared in the most solemn English reviews, and once or twice,
I believe, in state papers.</p>

<p>Much of the discussion of slang by popular etymologists is
devoted to proofs that this or that locution is not really slang
at all—that it is to be found in Shakespeare, in Milton, or in
the Revised Version. These scientists, of course, overlook the
plain fact that slang, like the folk-song, is not the creation of
people in the mass, but of definite individuals, and that its character
<i>as</i> slang depends entirely upon its adoption by the ignorant,
who use its novelties too assiduously and with too little
imagination, and so debase them to the estate of worn-out coins,
smooth and valueless. It is this error, often shared by philologists
of sounder information, that lies under the doctrine that
the plays of Shakespeare are full of slang, and that the Bard
showed but a feeble taste in language. Nothing could be more
absurd. The business of writing English, in his day, was unharassed
by the proscriptions of purists, and so the vocabulary
could be enriched more facilely than today, but though Shakespeare
and his fellow-dramatists quickly adopted such neologisms
as <i>to bustle</i>, <i>to huddle</i>, <i>bump</i>, <i>hubbub</i> and <i>pat</i>, it goes without
saying that they exercised a sound discretion and that the slang
of the Bankside was full of words and phrases which they were
never tempted to use. In our own day the same discrimination
is exercised by all writers of sound taste. On the one hand they
disregard the senseless prohibitions of school-masters, and on
the other hand they draw the line with more or less watchfulness,
according as they are of conservative or liberal habit. I <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg308"></a>[Pg308]</span>
find <i>the best of the bunch</i> and <i>joke-smith</i> in Saintsbury;<a name="FNanchor_10_481" id="FNanchor_10_481"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10_481" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> one
could scarcely imagine either in Walter Pater. But by the
same token one could not imagine <i>chicken</i> (for young girl),<a name="FNanchor_11_482" id="FNanchor_11_482"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11_482" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
<i>aber nit</i>, <i>to come across</i> or <i>to camouflage</i> in Saintsbury.</p>

<p>What slang actually consists of doesn't depend, in truth,
upon intrinsic qualities, but upon the surrounding circumstances.
It is the user that determines the matter, and particularly the
user's habitual way of thinking. If he chooses words carefully,
with a full understanding of their meaning and savor, then no
word that he uses seriously will belong to slang, but if his speech
is made up chiefly of terms poll-parroted, and he has no sense
of their shades and limitations, then slang will bulk largely in
his vocabulary. In its origin it is nearly always respectable;
it is devised not by the stupid populace, but by individuals of
wit and ingenuity; as Whitney says, it is a product of an "exuberance
of mental activity, and the natural delight of language-making."
But when its inventions happen to strike the popular
fancy and are adopted by the mob, they are soon worn thread-bare
and so lose all piquancy and significance, and, in Whitney's
words, become "incapable of expressing anything that is real."<a name="FNanchor_12_483" id="FNanchor_12_483"></a><a
href="#Footnote_12_483" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
This is the history of such slang phrases, often interrogative, as
"How'd you like to be the ice-man?" "How's your poor feet?"
"Merci pour la langouste," "Have a heart," "This is the life,"
"Where did you get that hat?" "Would you for fifty cents?"
"Let her go, Gallegher," "Shoo-fly, don't bother me," "Don't
wake him up" and "Let George do it." The last well exhibits
the process. It originated in France, as "Laissez faire à
Georges," during the fifteenth century, and at the start had
satirical reference to the multiform activities of Cardinal
Georges d'Amboise, prime minister to Louis XII.<a name="FNanchor_13_484" id="FNanchor_13_484"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13_484" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It later <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg309"></a>[Pg309]</span>
became common slang, was translated into English, had a revival
during the early days of David Lloyd-George's meteoric
career, was adopted into American without any comprehension
of either its first or its latest significance, and enjoyed the brief
popularity of a year.</p>

<p>Krapp attempts to distinguish between slang and sound idiom
by setting up the doctrine that the former is "more expressive
than the situation demands." "It is," he says, "a kind of
hyperesthesia in the use of language. <i>To laugh in your sleeve</i>
is idiom because it arises out of a natural situation; it is a
metaphor derived from the picture of one raising his sleeve to
his face to hide a smile, a metaphor which arose naturally
enough in early periods when sleeves were long and flowing;
but <i>to talk through your hat</i> is slang, not only because it is new,
but also because it is a grotesque exaggeration of the truth."<a name="FNanchor_14_485" id="FNanchor_14_485"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_485" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The theory, unluckily, is combated by many plain facts. <i>To
hand it to him</i>, <i>to get away with it</i> and even <i>to hand him a lemon</i>
are certainly not metaphors that transcend the practicable and
probable, and yet all are undoubtedly slang. On the other
hand, there is palpable exaggeration in such phrases as "he
is not worth the powder it would take to kill him," in such
adjectives as <i>break-bone</i> (fever), and in such compounds as
<i>fire-eater</i>, and yet it would be absurd to dismiss them as slang.
Between <i>block-head</i> and <i>bone-head</i> there is little to choose, but
the former is sound English, whereas the latter is American
slang. So with many familiar similes, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>like greased lightning</i>,
<i>as scarce as hen's teeth</i>; they are grotesque hyperboles,
but surely not slang.</p>

<p>The true distinction between slang and more seemly idiom, in
so far as any distinction exists at all, is that indicated by Whitney.
Slang originates in an effort, always by ingenious individuals,
to make the language more vivid and expressive. When
in the form of single words it may appear as new metaphors, <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg310"></a>[Pg310]</span>
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>bird</i> and <i>peach</i>; as back formations, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>beaut</i> and <i>flu</i>;
as composition-forms, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>whatdyecallem</i>; as picturesque compounds,
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>booze-foundry</i>; as onomatopes, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>biff</i> and <i>zowie</i>;
or in any other of the shapes that new terms take. If, by the
chances that condition language-making, it acquires a special
and limited meaning, not served by any existing locution, it
enters into sound idiom and is presently wholly legitimatized;
if, on the contrary, it is adopted by the populace as a counter-word
and employed with such banal imitativeness that it soon
loses any definite significance whatever, then it remains slang
and is avoided by the finical. An example of the former process
is afforded by <i>Tommy-rot</i>. It first appeared as English school-boy
slang, but its obvious utility soon brought it into good usage.
In one of Jerome K. Jerome's books, "Paul Kelver," there is the
following dialogue:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div>"The wonderful songs that nobody ever sings, the wonderful pictures
that nobody ever paints, and all the rest of it. It's <i>Tommy-rot</i>!"</div>

<div>"I wish you wouldn't use slang."</div>

<div>"Well, you know what I mean. What is the proper word? Give it
to me."</div>

<div>"I suppose you mean <i>cant</i>."</div>

<div>"No, I don't. <i>Cant</i> is something that
you don't believe in yourself. It's <i>Tommy-rot</i>; there isn't any other
word."</div></div>

<p>Nor was there any other word for <i>hubbub</i> and to <i>dwindle</i> in
Shakespeare's time; he adopted and dignified them because they
met genuine needs. Nor was there any other satisfactory word
for <i>graft</i> when it came in, nor for <i>rowdy</i>, nor for <i>boom</i>, nor for
<i>joy-ride</i>, nor for <i>omnibus-bill</i>, nor for <i>slacker</i>, nor for <i>trust-buster</i>.
Such words often retain a humorous quality; they are
used satirically and hence appear but seldom in wholly serious
discourse. But they have standing in the language nevertheless,
and only a prig would hesitate to use them as Saintsbury
used <i>the best of the bunch</i> and <i>joke-smith</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many an apt and ingenious neologism, by
falling too quickly into the gaping maw of the proletariat, is
spoiled forthwith. Once it becomes, in Oliver Wendell Holmes'
phrase, "a cheap generic term, a substitute for differentiated <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg311"></a>[Pg311]</span>
specific expressions," it quickly acquires such flatness that the
fastidious flee it as a plague. One recalls many capital verb-phrases,
thus ruined by unintelligent appreciation, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to hand
him a lemon</i>, <i>to freeze on to</i>, <i>to have the goods</i>, <i>to fall for it</i>,
and <i>to get by</i>. One recalls, too, some excellent substantives,
<i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>dope</i> and <i>dub</i>, and compounds, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>come-on</i> and <i>easy-mark</i>,
and verbs, <i class="abblatin">e. g.</i>, <i>to vamp</i>. These are all quite as sound in
structure as the great majority of our most familiar words, but
their adoption by the ignorant and their endless use and misuse
in all sorts of situations have left them tattered and obnoxious,
and they will probably go the way, as Matthews says, of all the
other "temporary phrases which spring up, one scarcely knows
how, and flourish unaccountably for a few months, and then
disappear forever, leaving no sign." Matthews is wrong in
two particulars here. They do not arise by any mysterious
parthenogenesis, but come from sources which, in many cases,
may be determined. And they last, alas, a good deal more than
a month. <i>Shoo-fly</i> afflicted the American people for at least two
years, and "I <i>don't</i> think" and <i>aber nit</i> quite as long. Even
"good-<i>night</i>" lasted a whole year.</p>

<p>A very large part of our current slang is propagated by the
newspapers, and much of it is invented by newspaper writers.
One needs but turn to the slang of baseball to find numerous
examples. Such phrases as <i>to clout the sphere</i>, <i>the initial sack</i>,
<i>to slam the pill</i> and <i>the dexter meadow</i> are obviously not of
bleachers manufacture. There is not enough imagination in
that depressing army to devise such things; more often than
not, there is not even enough intelligence to comprehend them.
The true place of their origin is the perch of the newspaper
reporters, whose competence and compensation is largely estimated,
at least on papers of wide circulation, by their capacity
for inventing novelties. The supply is so large that connoisseurship
has grown up; an extra-fecund slang-maker on the press
has his following. During the summer of 1913 the <cite>Chicago
Record-Herald</cite>, somewhat alarmed by the extravagant fancy of
its baseball reporters, asked its readers if they would prefer a
return to plain English. Such of them as were literate enough <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg312"></a>[Pg312]</span>
to send in their votes were almost unanimously against a change.
As one of them said, "one is nearer the park when Schulte
<i>slams the pill</i> than when he merely <i>hits the ball</i>." In all other
fields the newspapers originate and propagate slang, particularly
in politics. Most of our political slang-terms since the
Civil War, from <i>pork-barrel</i> to <i>steam-roller</i>, have been their inventions.
The English newspapers, with the exception of a few
anomalies such as the <i>Pink-Un</i>, lean in the other direction; their
fault is not slanginess, but an otiose ponderosity—in Dean
Alford's words, "the insisting on calling common things by
uncommon names; changing our ordinary short Saxon nouns
and verbs for long words derived from the Latin."<a name="FNanchor_15_486" id="FNanchor_15_486"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15_486" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
American newspapers, years ago, passed through such a stage
of bombast, but since the invention of yellow journalism by the
elder James Gordon Bennett—that is, the invention of journalism
for the frankly ignorant and vulgar—they have gone to the
other extreme. Edmund Clarence Stedman noted the change
soon after the Civil War. "The whole country," he wrote to
Bayard Taylor in 1873, "owing to the contagion of our newspaper
'exchange' system, is flooded, deluged, swamped beneath
a muddy tide of slang."<a name="FNanchor_16_487" id="FNanchor_16_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_487" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> A thousand alarmed watchmen have
sought to stay it since, but in vain. The great majority of our
newspapers, including all those of large circulation, are chiefly
written, as one observer says, "not in English, but in a strange
jargon of words that would have made Addison or Milton shudder
in despair."<a name="FNanchor_17_488" id="FNanchor_17_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_488" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p class="ph3number">§ 3</p>

<div class="ph3"><h3><a id="The_Future_of_the_Language"></a>The Future of the Language</h3>—The great
Jakob Grimm, the
founder of comparative philology, hazarded the guess more than
three-quarters of a century ago that English would one day become <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg313"></a>[Pg313]</span>
the chief language of the world, and perhaps crowd out
several of the then principal idioms altogether. "In wealth,
wisdom and strict economy," he said, "none of the other living
languages can vie with it." At that time the guess was bold,
for English was still in fifth place, with not only French and
German ahead of it, but also Spanish and Russian. In 1801,
according to Michael George Mulhall, the relative standing of
the five, in the number of persons using them, was as follows:</div>

<table summary="relative standing of five leading languages in 1801">
<tr>
 <td>French</td>
 <td>31,450,000</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td>Russian</td>
 <td>30,770,000</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td>German</td>
 <td>30,320,000</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td>Spanish</td>
 <td>26,190,000</td></tr>

 <td>20,520,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The population of the United States was then but little more
than 5,000,000, but in twenty years it had nearly doubled, and
thereafter it increased steadily and enormously, and by 1860
it was greater than that of the United Kingdom. Since that
time the majority of English-speaking persons in the world have
lived on this side of the water; today there are nearly three
times as many as in the United Kingdom and nearly twice as
many as in the whole British Empire. This great increase in
the American population, beginning with the great immigrations
of the 30's and 40's, quickly lifted English to fourth place among
the languages, and then to third, to second and to first. When
it took the lead the attention of philologists was actively directed
to the matter, and in 1868 one of them, a German named
Brackebusch, first seriously raised the question whether English
was destined to obliterate certain of the older tongues.<a name="FNanchor_18_489" id="FNanchor_18_489"></a><a

Brackebusch decided against on various philological grounds, <span

none of them sound. His own figures, as the following table

<p>This in 1868. Before another generation had passed the lead
of English, still because of the great growth of the United States,
was yet more impressive, as the following figures for 1890 show:</p>

<p>Today the figures exceed even these. They show that English
is now spoken by two and a half times as many persons as
spoke it at the close of the American Civil War and by nearly
eight times as many as spoke it at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. No other language has spread in any such proportions.
Even German, which is next on the list, shows but a
four-fold gain since 1801, or just half that of English. The
number of persons speaking Russian, despite the vast extension
of the Russian empire during the last century of the czars, has
little more than tripled, and the number speaking French has
less than doubled. But here are the figures for 1911:</p>

<p>Japanese, perhaps, should follow French: it is spoken by
60,000,000 persons. But Chinese may be disregarded, for it
is split into half a dozen mutually unintelligible dialects, and
shows no sign of spreading beyond the limits of China. The
same may be said of Hindustani, which is the language of 100,000,000
inhabitants of British India; it shows wide dialectical
variations and the people who speak it are not likely to spread.
But English is the possession of a race that is still pushing in
all directions, and wherever that race settles the existing languages
tend to succumb. Thus French, despite the passionate
resistance of the French-Canadians, is gradually decaying in
Canada; in all the newly-settled regions English is universal.
And thus Spanish is dying out in our own Southwest, and
promises to meet with severe competition in some of the nearer
parts of Latin-America. The English control of the sea has
likewise carried the language into far places. There is scarcely
a merchant ship-captain on deep water, of whatever nationality,
who does not find some acquaintance with it necessary, and it
has become, in debased forms, the <i class="abblatin">lingua franca</i> of Oceanica and
the Far East generally. "Three-fourths of the world's mail
matter," says E. H. Babbitt, "is now addressed in English,"
and "more than half of the world's newspapers are printed in
English."<a name="FNanchor_22_493" id="FNanchor_22_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_493" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Brackebusch, in the speculative paper just mentioned, came
to the conclusion that the future domination of English would
be prevented by its unphonetic spelling, its grammatical decay
and the general difficulties that a foreigner encounters in seeking
to master it. "The simplification of its grammar," he said,
"is the commencement of dissolution, the beginning of the end,
and its extraordinary tendency to degenerate into slang of <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg316"></a>[Pg316]</span>
every kind is the foreshadowing of its approaching dismemberment."
But in the same breath he was forced to admit that
"the greater development it has obtained" was the result of
this very simplification of grammar, and an inspection of the
rest of his reasoning quickly shows its unsoundness, even without
an appeal to the plain facts. The spelling of a language,
whether it be phonetic or not, has little to do with its spread.
Very few men learn it by studying books; they learn it by hearing
it spoken. As for grammatical decay, it is not a sign of
dissolution, but a sign of active life and constantly renewed
strength. To the professional philologist, perhaps, it may sometimes
appear otherwise. He is apt to estimate languages by
looking at their complexity; the Greek aorist elicits his admiration
because it presents enormous difficulties and is inordinately
subtle. But the object of language is not to bemuse grammarians,
but to convey ideas, and the more simply it accomplishes
that object the more effectively it meets the needs of
an energetic and practical people and the larger its inherent
vitality. The history of every language of Europe, since the
earliest days of which we have record, is a history of simplifications.
Even such languages as German, which still cling to a
great many exasperating inflections, including the absurd inflection
of the article for gender, are less highly inflected than
they used to be, and are proceeding slowly but surely toward
analysis. The fact that English has gone further along that
road than any other civilized tongue is not a proof of its decrepitude,
but a proof of its continued strength. Brought into
free competition with another language, say German or French
or Spanish, it is almost certain to prevail, if only because it is
vastly easier—that is, as a spoken language—to learn. The foreigner
essaying it, indeed, finds his chief difficulty, not in mastering
its forms, but in grasping its lack of forms. He doesn't
have to learn a new and complex grammar; what he has to
do is to forget grammar.</p>

<p>Once he has done so, the rest is a mere matter of acquiring
a vocabulary. He can make himself understood, given a few
nouns, pronouns, verbs and numerals, without troubling <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg317"></a>[Pg317]</span>
himself in the slightest about accidence. "Me see she" is bad
English, perhaps, but it would be absurd to say that it is obscure—and
on some not too distant tomorrow it may be very
fair American. Essaying an inflected language, the beginner
must go into the matter far more deeply before he may hope to
be understood. Bradley, in "The Making of English,"<a name="FNanchor_23_494" id="FNanchor_23_494"></a><a
href="#Footnote_23_494" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> shows
clearly how German and English differ in this respect, and how
great is the advantage of English. In the latter the verb <i>sing</i>
has but eight forms, and of these three are entirely obsolete,
one is obsolescent, and two more may be dropped out without
damage to comprehension. In German the corresponding verb,
<i>singen</i>, has no less than sixteen forms. How far English has
proceeded toward the complete obliteration of inflections is shown
by such barbarous forms of it as Pigeon English and Beach-la-Mar,
in which the final step is taken without appreciable loss
of clarity. The Pigeon English verb is identical in all tenses.
<i>Go</i> stands for both <i>went</i> and <i>gone</i>; <i>makee</i> is both <i>make</i> and <i>made</i>.
In the same way there is no declension of the pronoun for case.
<i>My</i> is thus <i>I</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>mine</i> and our own <i>my</i>. "No belong <i>my</i>" is
"it is not <i>mine</i>"—a crude construction, of course, but still
clearly intelligible. Chinamen learn Pigeon English in a few
months, and savages in the South Seas master Beach-la-Mar
almost as quickly. And a white man, once he has accustomed
himself to either, finds it strangely fluent and expressive. He
cannot argue politics in it, nor dispute upon transubstantiation,
but for all the business of every day it is perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>As we have seen in Chapters V and VI, the American dialect
of English has gone further along the road thus opened ahead
than the mother dialect, and is moving faster. For this reason,
and because of the fact that it is already spoken by a far larger
and more rapidly multiplying body of people than the latter, it
seems to me very likely that it will determine the final form of
the language. For the old control of English over American to
be reasserted is now quite unthinkable; if the two dialects are
not to drift apart entirely English must follow in American's
tracks. This yielding seems to have begun; the exchanges from <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg318"></a>[Pg318]</span>
American into English grow steadily larger and more important
than the exchanges from English into American. John Richard
Green, the historian, discerning the inevitable half a century ago,
expressed the opinion, amazing and unpalatable then, that the
Americans were already "the main branch of the English people."
It is not yet wholly true; a cultural timorousness yet
shows itself; there is still a class which looks to England as the
Romans long looked to Greece. But it is not the class that is
shaping the national language, and it is not the class that is
carrying it beyond the national borders. The Americanisms
that flood the English of Canada are not borrowed from the dialects
of New England Loyalists and fashionable New Yorkers,
but from the common speech that has its sources in the native
and immigrant proletariat and that displays its gaudiest freightage
in the newspapers.</p>

<p>The impact of this flood is naturally most apparent in Canada,
whose geographical proximity and common interests completely
obliterate the effects of English political and social
dominance. By an Order in Council, passed in 1890, the use
of the redundant <i>u</i> in such words as <i>honor</i> and <i>labor</i> is official
in Canada, but practically all the Canadian newspapers omit
it. In the same way the American flat <i>a</i> has swept whole sections
of the country, and American slang is everywhere used, and
the American common speech prevails almost universally in the
newer provinces. More remarkable is the influence that American
has exerted upon the speech of Australia and upon the crude
dialects of Oceanica and the Far East. One finds such obvious
Americanisms as <i>tomahawk</i>, <i>boss</i>, <i>bush</i>, <i>canoe</i>, <i>go finish</i> (=<i>to
die</i>) and <i>pickaninny</i> in Beach-la-Mar<a name="FNanchor_24_495" id="FNanchor_24_495"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24_495" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and more of them in
Pigeon English. And one observes a very large number of
American words and phrases in the slang of Australia. The
Australian common speech, in pronunciation and intonation,
resembles Cockney English, and a great many Cockneyisms are
in it, but despite the small number of Americans in the Antipodes <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg319"></a>[Pg319]</span>
it has adopted, of late, so many Americanisms that a Cockney
visitor must often find it difficult. Among them are the
verb and verb-phrases, <i>to beef</i>, <i>to biff</i>, <i>to bluff</i>, <i>to boss</i>, <i>to break
away</i>, <i>to chase one's self</i>, <i>to chew the rag</i>, <i>to chip in</i>, <i>to fade
away</i>, <i>to get it in the neck</i>, <i>to back and fill</i>, <i>to plug along</i>, <i>to get
sore</i>, <i>to turn down</i> and <i>to get wise</i>; the substantives, <i>dope</i>, <i>boss</i>,
<i>fake</i>, <i>creek</i>, <i>knockout-drops</i> and <i>push</i> (in the sense of <i>crowd</i>);
the adjectives, <i>hitched</i> (in the sense of <i>married</i>) and <i>tough</i> (as
before <i>luck</i>), and the adverbial phrases, <i>for keeps</i> and <i>going
strong</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_496" id="FNanchor_25_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_496" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Here, in direct competition with English locutions,
and with all the advantages on the side of the latter, American
is making steady progress.</p>

<p>"This American language," says a recent observer, "seems
to be much more of a pusher than the English. For instance,
after eight years' occupancy of the Philippines it was spoken
by 800,000, or 10 per cent, of the natives, while after an occupancy
of 150 of India by the British, 3,000,000, or one per cent,
of the natives speak English."<a name="FNanchor_26_497" id="FNanchor_26_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_497" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I do vouch for the figures.
They may be inaccurate, in detail, but they at least state what
seems to be a fact. Behind that fact are phenomena which certainly
deserve careful study, and, above all, study divested of
unintelligent prejudice. The attempt to make American uniform
with English has failed ingloriously; the neglect of its investigation
is an evidence of snobbishness that is a folly of the
same sort. It is useless to dismiss the growing peculiarities of
the American vocabulary and of grammar and syntax in the
common speech as vulgarisms beneath serious notice. Such vulgarisms
have a way of intrenching themselves, and gathering
dignity as they grow familiar. "There are but few forms in
use," says Lounsbury, "which, judged by a standard previously
existing, would not be regarded as gross barbarisms."<a name="FNanchor_27_498" id="FNanchor_27_498"></a><a
href="#Footnote_27_498" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Each language, in such matters, is a law unto itself, and each
vigorous dialect, particularly if it be spoken by millions, is a <span
class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg320"></a>[Pg320]</span>
law no less. "It would be as wrong," says Sayce, "to use <i>thou</i>
for the nominative <i>thee</i> in the Somersetshire dialect as it is to
say <i>thee art</i> instead of <i>you are</i> in the Queen's English." All
the American dialect needs, in the long run, to make even pedagogues
acutely aware of it, is a poet of genius to venture into
it, as Chaucer ventured into the despised English of his day,
and Dante into the Tuscan dialect, and Luther, in his translation
of the Bible, into peasant German. Walt Whitman made
a half attempt and then drew back; Lowell, perhaps, also heard
the call, but too soon. The Irish dialect of English, vastly less
important than the American, has already had its interpreters—Douglas
Hyde, John Milington Synge and Augusta Gregory—and
with what extraordinary results we all know. Here we
have writing that is still indubitably English, but English rid
of its artificial restraints and broken to the less self-conscious
grammar and syntax of a simple and untutored folk. Synge, in
his preface to "The Playboy of the Western World,"<a name="FNanchor_28_499" id="FNanchor_28_499"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_499" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> tells
us how he got his gypsy phrases "through a chink in the floor
of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear
what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen." There
is no doubt, he goes on, that "in the happy ages of literature
striking and beautiful phrases were as ready to the story-teller's
or the playwright's hand as the rich cloaks and dresses of his
time. It is probable that when the Elizabethan dramatist took
his ink-horn and sat down to his work he used many phrases
that he had just heard, as he sat at dinner, from his mother or
his children."</p>

<p>The result, in the case of the neo-Celts, is a dialect that stands
incomparably above the tight English of the grammarians—a
dialect so naïf, so pliant, so expressive, and, adeptly managed,
so beautiful that even purists have begun to succumb to it, and
it promises to leave lasting marks upon English style. The
American dialect has not yet come to that stage. In so far as it
is apprehended at all it is only in the sense that Irish-English
was apprehended a generation ago—that is, as something
<span class="xxpgno"><a id="Pg321"></a>[Pg321]</span> uncouth and comic.
But that is the way that new dialects always
come in—through a drum-fire of cackles. Given the poet, there
may suddenly come a day when our <i>theirns</i> and <i>would'a hads</i>
will take on the barbaric stateliness of the peasant locutions of
old Maurya in "Riders to the Sea." They seem grotesque and
absurd today because the folks who use them seem grotesque and
absurd. But that is a too facile logic and under it is a false
assumption. In all human beings, if only understanding be
brought to the business, dignity will be found, and that dignity
cannot fail to reveal itself, soon or late, in the words and
phrases with which they make known their high hopes and aspirations
and cry out against the intolerable meaninglessness of
life.</p>

<p>This book is full of italicized words and phrases. For this html or
mobile edition, an attempt has been made to distinguish different
types of italics. There are four classes, described roughly as
follows: 1) <i>words or phrases</i> being discussed <i class="abblatin">qua</i> text; 2)
<cite>literature citations</cite>; 3) text receiving <em>emphasis</em>; and 4) ordinary
mundane <i class="abblatin">italics</i> such as latin, foreign words, or
abbreviations. Depending on the browser used, these classes may have
differing appearance.</p>

<p>Page 18: "Prof. F. Lanenscheidt" probably refers to "Prof. F.
Langenscheidt", but the original spelling has been retained because it
is repeated in an Index entry. Also, in "Sprachen und Literaturen by
Prof. Felix Flügel,[21]", changed the footnote anchor to 31.</p>

<p>Page 20: quotation mark added to the end of "we have no dialects.".</p>

<p>Page 42, footnote 9: "<i>Beaver and Hunting</i>" changed to <i>Beaver</i> and
<i>Hunting</i>.</p>

<p>Page 66, footnote 6, "Lewis and Clarke" changed to "Lewis and Clark"
(but recall that footnotes have been moved to the ends of chapters—so
this particular footnote now appears between pages 96 and 97.).</p>

<p>Page 92: "a-n-aice" on page 92 appears as "a-ñ-aice" in the index on
page 340.</p>

<p>Page 103, footnote 4: this footnote was printed on two line, which
originally were printed incorrectly in reverse order. They have been
switched.</p>

<p>Page 108, footnote 9: the original phrase "<i class="abblatin">Cf.</i> Don't Shy at
<cite>Journalist, the Editor and Publisher and Journalist</cite>, June 27, 1914."
seemed to have the italics placed incorrectly. This phrase was changed
to "<i class="abblatin">Cf.</i> Don't Shy at Journalist, <cite>The Editor and Publisher and
Journalist</cite>, June 27, 1914".</p>

<p>Page 112, footnote 14: opening quotation mark added to "has so
ingrained itself".</p>

<p>Page 124, footnote 29: "universites" is misspelled, but it is not
entirely clear that this is a mistake.</p>

<p>Page 125, footnote 32: changed "Enlishman" to "Englishman".</p>

<p>Page 157, closing quotation mark added to "und gehn in <i>street</i> für a
<i>walk</i>.".</p>

<p>Page 163: "<i>shoot-the-chutes and grape-juice-diplomacy</i>" changed to
"<i>shoot-the-chutes</i> and <i>grape-juice-diplomacy</i>".</p>

<p>Page 172: "<i>vois avez</i>" probably should be "<i>vous avez</i>", but has been
retained as the incorrect form appears also in the index.</p>

<p>Page 173, footnote 90: "Essai Raissoné dur la Grammaire" changed to
"Essai Raisonné sur la Grammaire".</p>

<p>Page 214: "they and thine" to "thy and thine".</p>

<p>Page 226: "(=wide)" to "(=<i>wide</i>)".</p>

<p>Page 251: "macheen" to "masheen". This change agrees with an entry in
the index, and fits the context better.</p>

<p>Page 278: "Karzeniowski" to "Korzeniowski", both here and in the
corresponding index entry on page 353.</p>

<p>Page 279, footnote 24: "flaggelation" to "flagellation".</p>

<p>Page 282: "<i>Drewry</i>, <i>Droit</i>," to "<i>Drewry</i>, <i>Droit</i>;".</p>

<p>Page 296: "discreet" would probably be considered incorrect now, but
this word is present in Webster's Unabridged Dictionaries published in
1913 and in 1828.</p>

<p>Page 297, footnote 44: "decisons" to "decisions".</p>

<p>Page 310: "you mean <i>cant</i>. No, I don't." changed to "you mean
<i>cant</i>."¶"No, I don't." (Two quotation marks, and a paragraph break
inserted).</p>

<p>Page 315, footnote 22: "spokne" to "spoken".</p>

<p>Page 331: "Prounciation" to "Pronunciation".</p>

<p>Page 340: "anemia, 242, 262" to "anemia, 242, 263". Also, in
"anti-fogmatic, IR", "IR" to "84". Note that the "I" and "R" keys are
close to the "8" and "4" keys on a qwertyop keyboard.</p>

<p>Page 341: "Beaver Moon, 4wn" changed to "Beaver Moon, 42n". This is an
educated guess—but "Beaver and Hunting" is mentioned on page 42,
footnote 9, as one of the Indian months (moons?). Also note that the
"2" key is near the "w" key on a qwertyop keyboard, and there are six
instances of this or similar (probable) mistake in the index—see
below and just above.</p>

<p>Page 347: "discipine, 251" to "discipline, 251".</p>

<p>Page 348: "encylopaedia, 243" to "encyclopaedia, 243". Also "eychre"
to "euchre".</p>

<p>Page 353: "Johanssen" to "Johannsen", to agree with the corresponding
reference on page 275. Also "keylesswatch" to "keyless-watch" to agree
with its page references.</p>

<p>Page 354: in "lot, 31, 51, 52, 5wn", "5wn" to "52n", referencing
footnote 28 anchored on page 52, which discusses "lott".</p>

<p>Page 355: "mass, OR" to "mass, 94", consistent with the logic of the
qwertyop keyboard, see above.</p>

<p>Page 360: "ruby-nonpariel" to "ruby-nonpareil". Also, "saloon-loafer"
to "saloon loafer".</p>

<p>Page 365: "twelvemonth, 114.¶23, 161." to "twelvemonth, 114.¶{word
missing?} 23, 161.", to indicate a possible missing reference word.
Also, the entry "Traveler's Moon, 4wn" is changed to "Traveler's Moon,
42n", referring to footnote 9 on page 42.</p>

<p>Page 366: "Wilkewicz" to "Wilkiewicz".</p>

<p>Page 369: "Buckler, H. G., 314n" to "Buehler, H. G., 314n". This
refers to footnote 20 of Chapter IX. Also, "Gessellschaft" to
"Gesellschaft".</p>

<p>Page 371: "Longfellow, H. W., RI" to "Longfellow, H. W., 48",
consistent with the logic of the qwertyop keyboard, see above.</p>

<p>Page 374: for entry Wilson, Woodrow, "1161" to "161". Also, for
entry Taylor, Bayard, "372" to "312".</p>

<p>A few spelling mistakes have been fixed without remark here.</p>
